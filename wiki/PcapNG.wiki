==pcap-ng File Format==
  * The pcap-ng file format was intended to supersede the previous [http://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/LibpcapFileFormat libpcap file format] in the long-term, and fixes several shortcomings and limitations in that file format
  * As of writing, the current draft specification is [http://www.winpcap.org/ntar/draft/PCAP-DumpFileFormat.html here], and is subject to change at any time
  * A number of sample captures, containing several different protocols, link-layer types and format features are available on our [http://code.google.com/p/understand/downloads/list Downloads] page (tagged with "[http://code.google.com/p/understand/downloads/list?q=label:ntar ntar]" and "[http://code.google.com/p/understand/downloads/list?q=label:pcapng pcapng]")
  * Additional sample files are available at [http://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/PcapNg this page] on the Wireshark Wiki 

==Conversion/Encapsulation Issues and Current (Implementation) Shortfalls/Bugs==
===Wireshark (1.3.0-SVN train)===
  * Saving [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPNSS DPNSS] packets from [http://understand.googlecode.com/files/D-1-Anonymous-Anonymous-D-OFF-27d01m2009y-00h00m00s-0a0None.trc EyeSDN trace files] into pcap-ng files produces packets with {{{WTAP_ENCAP}}} set to {{{0}}}, and the data cannot be dissected - it seems that there is no DLT value for DPNSS at present
  * Storing Linux mmapped USB packets in pcap-ng files produces files with unusable metadata (e.g. all packets are dissected as {{{URB_ISOCHRONOUS}}} regardless of type) - Reported as [https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3560 bug 3560] 
  * {{{Juniper ATM1 PIC}}} {{{VC-MUX}}} packets in libpcap files become {{{ATM OAM Cell}}} packets when saved into pcap-ng files, and cannot be dissected for a currently unknown reason
  * I<sup>2</sup>C/IPMB bus and event type information is lost when packets from libpcap files are saved as pcap-ng (bus number is reset to {{{255}}}, and event type is set to {{{0x4783c623}}} ({{{unknown state event}}})
  * It appears that it is not possible currently, to export Bluetooth HCI H1 packets in Symbian OS btsnoop capture files to pcap-ng
==Mailing Lists==
Evolution of the pcap-ng file format is driven by several mailing lists. These are splintered between the following:
