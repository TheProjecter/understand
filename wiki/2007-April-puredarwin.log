17:15 < vmlemon> Hi
17:15 < bbraun> hello
17:16 < probono> hi vmlemon
17:16 < probono> so kvv kept his promise :)
17:16 < bbraun> of?
17:16 < vmlemon> Don't we want to put some info on the PureDarwin:About page about the project?
17:16 < probono> 10.4.9 souce is released
17:17 < bbraun> ah
17:17 < probono> source even
17:21 < probono> vmlemon: about page done :)
17:21 < vmlemon> OK
17:22 < vmlemon> Yay, it worked
17:22 < probono> hm, seems not to work
17:22 < probono> it did? then it's my cache ;)
17:22 < vmlemon> (Redirected from PureDarwin:About)
17:22 < probono> how do you like the design? made it a bit more mac like than pure mediawiki
17:23 < vmlemon> It's quite nice
17:23 < vmlemon> And it loads quickly, too
17:24 < probono> looks best on a mac :)
17:24 < vmlemon> I've got step by step instructions for upgrading XNU to 8.1.0
17:24 < vmlemon> Not sure about to the very latest and greatest, though
17:25 < probono> that's great. current goal is darwin 8.9 of course
17:25 < vmlemon> Konqueror on KDE, here
17:25 < probono> but it's a good intermediate step
17:25 < vmlemon> Shall I add them anyway, or should I let you see them first?
17:26 < probono> well i think since it's not mac binary compatible, it should go on some special page with an appropriate disclaimer
17:26 < vmlemon> OK
17:27 < probono> bbraun and kvv explained in detail why darwin 8.0.1 isn't binary compatible
17:27 < vmlemon> I haven't been able to upgrade the kernel further than 8.1.0, so I don't know what else would need to be done
17:27 < probono> key takeaway is that if we build darwin 8.9 it should be :)
17:27 < vmlemon> What about hosting precompiled kernels somewhere?
17:27 < probono> so let's collect instructions on compiling 8.9 on http://puredarwin.org/wiki/index.php/Compiling_Darwin
17:28 < probono> i think the license allows redistribution
17:28 < bbraun> FYI: www.opendarwin.org/~bbraun/darwin8-player.zip that is a vmware virtual machine w/darwin 8.0.1 installed and usable with the free vmware player
17:28 < probono> cool. will that link stay?
17:28 < bbraun> not for more than a few weeks.  Maybe until wwdc
17:28  * probono never knows which parts of opendarwin.org will disappear tomorrow
17:29 < probono> bbraun: if we organize hosting, would you be willing to give us copies before you delete stuff forever?
17:29 < vmlemon> Where's PDo hosted at the moment?
17:29 < bbraun> feel free to grab what you want.  I think the goal is to get od gone with the minimal amount of work necessary
17:30 < probono> would it make sense to approach ISC?
17:31 < bbraun> I somehow doubt it
17:31 < probono> are you the key ISC contact, bbraun?
17:31 < probono> vmlemon: http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/about/press/?pr=2004092801
17:31 < vmlemon> OK
17:32 < bbraun> I've been associated with ISC in various forms for almost 10yrs now, and was the initial person who worked with isc to get opendarwin going, yeah
17:33 < probono> suppose we get 8.9 compiled. we'd need to put it somewhere :)
17:33 < vmlemon> I'm on Dynamic IP so it won't be available at the same IP again, but see 86.152.12.182/namikiteru/macos.html for the guide to installing the 8.1.0 kernel
17:34 < vmlemon> The original site has been dead for about 2 years now
17:34 < bbraun> sourceforge is always an option
17:35 < vmlemon> I've heard that SourceForge is going downhill as of late, but I don't know much more about it
17:36 < bbraun> it is.  I wouldn't recommend hosting a project there, but taking advantage of their bw for downloads might be tolerable
17:36 < probono> projects moving to goole?
17:37 < vmlemon> I know some have been moving to Google Code Hosting or whatever they called it as of late
17:37 < bbraun> xar is on google and it is ok.  However, they have a limit on size.
17:38 < bbraun> their subversion, wiki, and issue tracker are tolerable and stable.  Downloads are really meant for smaller projects than a complete OS distribution.
17:38 < bbraun> They do mention they can up the limit if there is a good reason, so it might be worth investigating
17:39 < vmlemon> As far as I know, Mac OS X proper supports Linux ELF format binaries, but does the new kernel support them?
17:39 < probono> it does?
17:39 < bbraun> I do not believe that is accurate
17:40 < probono> through qemu perhas
17:40 < vmlemon> I don't know for sure, unless it was something that was planned at some stage and dropped
17:40 < probono> vmlemon: what is the xnu version your instructions give us?
17:40 < vmlemon> Just going to check
17:41  * probono wonders about the strange and often confused versioning scheme
17:41 < bbraun> which versioning scheme?
17:43 < probono> darwin != xnu versions
17:43 < probono> != mac os versions
17:44 < bbraun> mac os versions are marketing numbers and only vaguely describe the bits.
17:44 < probono> ah :)
17:44 < vmlemon> probono: It upgrades it to 792.1.5 from 792
17:44 < probono> would make a good quote for http://puredarwin.org/wiki/index.php/Darwin_versions :)
17:44 < bbraun> darwin releases are typically numbered the same as xnu version numbers (in the 1.3, 1.4, 6, 7, 8 scheme, not 792 scheme), but with a .1 appended
17:45 < probono> vmlemon: good. i'll set up a wiki page
17:45 < vmlemon> OK
17:45 < probono> 792 is kind of a strange number
17:45 < bbraun> the .1 is to differentiate darwin release from an osx release of xnu
17:45 < bbraun> that is the monotonically increasing tag number of the sources used internally.
17:45 < vmlemon> Do we want the uname -a string at all?
17:46 < bbraun> the .'s on the end are for subsequent releases on a branch of one tag of the sources
17:49 < vmlemon> Could not send confirmation mail. Check address for invalid characters. 
17:49 < vmlemon> Mailer returned: SAFE MODE Restriction in effect. The mail() command is not allowed
17:49 < vmlemon> When setting up a new Wiki acount
17:53 < probono> http://puredarwin.org/wiki/index.php/Upgrading_xnu_to_792.1.5
17:53 < probono> vmlemon: yes, the wiki registration/setup part will change
17:54 < probono> if you sign up now, you'll have to sign up again when the new system is in place
17:56 < vmlemon> xar looks really promising
17:58 -!- semilia|off [n=have@pD9E7E424.dip.t-dialin.net] has quit [Read error: 113 (No route to host)]
18:00 < probono> indeed
18:00 < probono> maybe it'll become the base for the next apple installer
18:00 < vmlemon> Does it work on Linux?
18:01 < vmlemon> It's nice to see that something is under development that actually preserves metadata between platforms, instead of disposing or leaving it behind
18:06 < probono> vmlemon: be free to improve the formatting of that page
18:06 < probono> also, in accordance with general wiki style, you might consider changing the 'I' style to the 'you' style ;)
18:07 < vmlemon> I didn't write it, I just found it, so I don't know what the best way to Wikify it would be
18:07 < probono> ah :)
18:08 < vmlemon> If it hadn't have been for finding it on Archive.org, it would have been lost forever ;)
18:08 < probono> maybe we should find that guy
18:09 < probono> the nice thing about the darwin community is that most people know each other since it's so small
18:09 < vmlemon> Good idea, it's a shame that really useful resources vanish forever in the space of a few years or months :(
18:09 < probono> indeed
18:10 < probono> that's why we should work with bbraun to conserve what we can
18:11 < vmlemon> I don't mean it in a bad way, but Darwin seems to be obscure enough for people to toy with, and suddenly forget that it ever existed
18:12 < vmlemon> At the same time, their sites and resources that they made available are never to be seen again
18:13 < probono> it's all about building a critical mass, and the intel switch certainly changed the picture here
18:13 < probono> as well as the general rising apple mindshare
18:13 < vmlemon> Everyone who can is building "Hackintoshes" and buying AppleTVs in spades to dissect, now
18:14 < probono> and at the same time mostly fails to understand the fundamentals. oh well. who can operate the innards of a car?
18:20 < probono> wikified a bit more
18:20 < vmlemon> OK
18:22 < vmlemon> Much better
18:26 < vmlemon> Are we allowed to reverse engineer the acpi.kext blob? Or does the license not permit?
18:27 < probono> no reverse engineering, but the acpi specs are open
18:27 < vmlemon> OK
18:28 < vmlemon> Of course, if we're striving for "Pure Darwin", it's probably best to keep the blobs as Apple intended, otherwise it's not "pure", unless someone disagrees with me
18:29 < probono> we should try to be as "pure" as possible
18:29 < probono> then of course we can add on top of that
18:29 < vmlemon> Getting things like X Windows and KDE would be nice to haves
18:30 < probono> maybe we should talk to proclus... or we shouldn't
18:32 < vmlemon> Has anyone other than me here seen InsanelyMac?
18:33 < probono> they're a pirate site, we are not
18:36 < vmlemon> Just wondering, does xar preserve Macintosh resource forks?
18:36 < bbraun> yes
18:36 < bbraun> on Mac OS X 10.4, resource forks are extended attributes
18:37 < vmlemon> OK
18:37 < probono> bbraun: how does the build number scheme like "8P2127" work (and relate to anything else)?
18:38 < bbraun> I covered the source versions earlier.  Source gets submitted to builds.  Each build is numbered.  Any given project (such as xnu) is not necessarily submitted with every build (there are lots of projects that can be changed and submitted...).
18:39 < vmlemon> Is building a usuable Darwin distribution for everyday use one of our primary goals? Or is that just something that is achieved through what PureDarwin does?
18:40 < bbraun> the build numbering scheme has gone through changes, but currently, the first number, '8' in this case, refers to the release number (darwin 8, xnu 8, etc).  The letter refers to a software update release (not always software updates, sometimes new hardware gets a new letter), and the number '2147' is the number of builds monotonically increasing
18:41 < probono> and 2147 = x86 while 147 = ppc ?
18:41 < bbraun> afaik, the numbers are totally independent, but I do not know that for sure.  x86 was released after I left apple.
18:42 < vmlemon> Yay, xar compiles cleanly and perfectly without a fuss, which is something that I haven't seen in a while
18:43 < bbraun> are you using 1.4 or trunk from subversion?
18:43 < vmlemon> 1.4
18:44 < vmlemon> I guess trunk has some extra goodness that might be worth a look?
18:44 < bbraun> I recommend the one from subversion, it has a lot of fixes and more osx specific features
18:45 < vmlemon> Can I append files to existing archives after creation?
18:45 < bbraun> not as such, no
19:24 < probono> is there a way to find out which source package contains a certain file? such as packages.debian.org?
19:24 < probono> might help in compiling
19:25 < bbraun> no.  kvv used to have a cgi which searched the darwinbuild files of past releases, but that is no longer available @opendarwin
19:26 < probono> ah. so a little php database with all the files wouldn't proably hurt
19:27 < probono> i'll start with 10.4.9 x86

16:24 < probono> hi vmlemon
16:24 < vmlemon> Any progress on PDo?
16:25 < probono> PDo? PureDarwinOnline?
16:25 < vmlemon> PureDarwin.org
16:25 < probono> ah :)
16:25 < probono> sure:
16:25 < probono> pPDo
16:25 < vmlemon> Kind of like OpenOffice.org (Which is their official name, AFAIK)
16:25 < vmlemon> *OOo
16:26 < probono> pPDo is a search tool for source packages
16:26 < probono> http://packages.puredarwin.org/
16:27 < probono> loosely modeled after packages.ubuntu.com
16:27 < vmlemon> Yay
16:27 < vmlemon> It's nice
16:28 < probono> next step is to link the sources of the individual files
16:28 < vmlemon> Just has the Darwin stock sources in it?
16:28 < probono> to make things mroe accessible
16:28 < vmlemon> The directory listings with permissions are interesting
16:28 < probono> currently it has all darwin stock sources of current and older versions
16:29 < probono> it clearly shows that kvv has been involved in >75% of all darwin packages :)
16:30 < vmlemon> Will there be a polished, branded PureDarwin distro ISO like the Linux ones in the near future?
16:30 < probono> shortly after leopard we can expect kvv to publish his
16:30 < probono> as he has done in the past
16:31 < vmlemon> What about a PurePorts system, where packages that have been tested and found to work without problems are collected?
16:33 < probono> vmlemon: that's step 2.
16:33 < probono> step 1 is to get a recent pure darwin running.
16:33  * probono is off for the next 30+ mins
16:35 < vmlemon> Just looking at the Packages.PDo Wiki, I wonder if Klik would work, since it uses ELF binaries compiled for Linux, AFAIK
16:35 < vmlemon> It would be a nice to have, though
16:36 < bbraun> I think you should call it darwinports
16:37 < vmlemon> Didn't they already have DarwinPorts?
16:37 < bbraun> it's macports now, and when it was darwinports, it was never for darwin.
16:37 < vmlemon> OK
16:37 < vmlemon> Good idea on reusing the name, since it's a more Darwin centric use of it
16:38 < bbraun> ya
16:39 < vmlemon> Some interesting tips on PDo Wiki at the moment
16:40 < bbraun> tips?
16:41 < vmlemon> Like the one on getting all the packages from Apple in one go from the shell and uninstalling packages
17:07 -!- semilia|off [n=have@pD9E7E2B0.dip.t-dialin.net] has joined #puredarwin
17:14 < probono> hi semilia|off
17:14 < probono> vmlemon: funny that you cite klik
17:15 < vmlemon> It's mentioned heavily at http://packages.puredarwin.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page for some reason
17:15 < probono> ah :)
17:15 < probono> that url doesn't exist
17:15 < probono> (it's a server mistake)
17:16 < vmlemon> Works here
17:16 < probono> it's an error
17:16 < vmlemon> OK
17:23 < probono> vmlemon: fied
17:23 < probono> fixed
17:23 < vmlemon> OK
17:23 < probono> how do you like the package search?
17:23 < probono> any ideas for improvement?
17:23 < vmlemon> It's really good
17:24 < vmlemon> The permissions and full package filename listings seem useful
17:25 < vmlemon> Adding a link to download the file to it?
17:25 < vmlemon> If it doesn't do it already
17:25 < vmlemon> Oh, it does
17:25 < probono> sure :)
17:25 < vmlemon> Adding the ability to see which Darwin version the package corresponds to?
17:26 < probono> good point :)
17:28 < vmlemon> Not sure how well it would work, but a "version timeline" for each package and a listing of the contents of each new version of packages making up a Darwin version might work
17:29 < vmlemon> (going from the first Darwin x86 release to the most current)

17:51 < probono> vmlemon: kind of a timeline implemented :)
17:54 < vmlemon> Cool
17:56 < vmlemon> How are you getting the data from the packages? Do you download a copy and process it, or is the info prestored?
17:56 < probono> downloaded & processed it
17:56 < vmlemon> OK
17:56 < probono> the hardcore way :)
17:57 < probono> once we have a sponsor, we can do a fulltext search engine
17:57 < vmlemon> Kind of like Google Code Search but on a smaller scale?
17:58 < probono> yes
17:59 < probono> google search has opendarwin.org indexed, but i'm afraid it'll disappear rather soon
18:00 < vmlemon> OpenDarwin is slowly switching into "supernova mode" once the domain expires and such?
18:00 < probono> "supernova mode" lol
18:01 < probono> the term "acpi" is  contained in 25 packages
18:02 < vmlemon> 3004 files in xnu-792.tar.gz
18:03 < vmlemon> Can I add a link to it to the wiki?
18:04 < probono> i'm doing it atm
18:04 < vmlemon> OK
18:08 < semilia> hi
18:08 < semilia> how is gon he?
18:08 < semilia> here?
18:08 < probono> hi semilia
18:10 < probono> just working on http://packages.puredarwin.org/
18:17 < vmlemon> Would it be a good idea to mirror some of the old OpenDarwin stuff before it's lost forever somewhere?
18:17 < semilia> where you got all the content from of archs from?
18:17 < semilia> i have a complete mirror of all opendarwin stuff
18:17 < vmlemon> 17:56 < probono> downloaded & processed it
18:17 < vmlemon> 17:56 < probono> the hardcore way :)
18:18 < vmlemon> (I posed the same question, earlier)
18:19 < probono> downloaded all things apsl from apple
18:20 < probono> it's all linked to the apple urls
18:20 < vmlemon> You have a script that grovels for all the data and adds it to the DB?
18:20 < vmlemon> Or is it entirely hand added?
18:22 < probono> if i did it by hand, it would be done around the time when leo comes out :)
18:22 < vmlemon> Explains the consistency ;)
18:22 < vmlemon> I wonder if they'll make a release called Lion
18:23 < vmlemon> Since they don't seem to have used it
18:23 < semilia> only apsl stuff on apple is far not everything itnresting :)
18:24 < vmlemon> Oh, Mac OS Y or Z might be out by then ;)
18:24 < semilia> i have whole opendarwin (darwinsource, darwinports, opendarwin) ftp mirror and the complete apsl stuff ever hosted by apple if anyone needs
18:25 < probono> sure, that'll rock once we have hosting for it
18:25 < probono> nice full text search for it
18:25 < probono> or let google code spider it
18:25 < vmlemon> bbraun: Will we have Xar included in the distro?
18:26 < semilia> oh btw. who are you vmlemon? :)
18:27 < vmlemon> Who? Doing a whois on my site (house404.co.uk) will probably tell you everything you want to know ;)
18:27 < bbraun> in what distro?
18:28 < vmlemon> the PureDarwin distro, when it materializes
18:28 < bbraun> depends on if someone adds it.  =)
18:28 < semilia> lol not ment like that :P
18:29 < vmlemon> Just general stuff? 
18:29 < semilia> yeah
18:30 < vmlemon> I'm in the process of learning Perl, if it helps anything, and I spend quite a lot of time in #amarok helping out there, and run the #lightstream channel for the Eggdrop bot of the same name (LightStream), and the house404.co.uk site
18:31 < semilia> ah ok :)
18:31 < bbraun> and I'm just an observer
18:34 < vmlemon> I also happen to have an interest in network protocols, obscure operating systems, filesytems and trying to dissect binaries for different OSes ;)
18:35 < vmlemon> I'm a cr*p coder though, and don't know any C/C++, so I can't be much use there
18:35 < semilia> bbraun: as former opendarwin guy, which kext of osx are free to sue with darwin and are redistributable?
18:36 < bbraun> nothing from osx
18:37 < semilia> kvv said something about acpi i.e. has a license for usage with darwin?
18:37 < bbraun> darwin kexts are redistributable for the express purpose of using with darwin.
18:37 < bbraun> osx kexts are not redistributable in any form or purpose
18:38 < vmlemon> As far is I know, the ACPI kext won't be made Sources Available/Open Source 
18:38 < semilia> well what discribes a "darwin" kext?
18:38 < vmlemon> One that ships in a stock installation of Darwin, probably
18:38 < semilia> vmlemon: there is no stock darwin
18:39 < bbraun> a kext that is distributed by Apple with darwin
18:39 < bbraun> darwin is distributed by apple.
18:39 < semilia> can we define darwin please?
18:40 < bbraun> to the best of my understanding, this channel uses darwin in the sense of a standalone OS
18:41 < semilia> yes, well see there was opendarwin and there is macosx and apsl opensourced parts
18:41 < bbraun> those have nothing to do with darwin in this context
18:42 < semilia> well let'S say i take apsl opensourcecode to buidl a standalone darwin distribution
18:42 < semilia> there are mayn files not opensource
18:42 < bbraun> correct
18:42 < semilia> needed files
18:42 < semilia> those are only foudn on i.e. a osx isntall
18:42 < vmlemon> As far as I know, Mac OS X is simply a Darwin distribution that contains a large number of closed components that make it Mac OS X
18:42 < bbraun> you cannot distribute anything that comes from osx
18:43 < bbraun> that is covered by osx's eula
18:43 < semilia> well how opendarwin solved the problem not to have these kext?
18:43 < semilia> or needed parts
18:43 < bbraun> opendarwin distributed kexts that came from darwin.
18:43 < vmlemon> In theory, you could strip some of the components away, and just have Darwin as a base, but it doesn't not make it Mac OS X
18:44 < bbraun> vmlemon: no, you cannot.  osx components are different from darwin components
18:44 < bbraun> merely deleting everything not in darwin from an osx install will give you something different from what you would get if you installed darwin.
18:45 < semilia> bbraun: this does not fit, how a omnious darwin shoudl work without the none opensource parts?
18:45 < semilia> there is basicly no such thing as a real working distributed darwin
18:45 < semilia> onyl parts
18:45 < bbraun> semilia: there is a distributed real working darwin, distributed by apple
18:45 < semilia> bbraun than show me where it is please
18:46 < vmlemon> Well, that is probably true, it would be merely Darwin-esque, and probably be classed as a derivative of Mac OS X that Apple shipped, and wouldn't be classifiable as "Darwin", but I'm probably wrong
18:46 < bbraun> http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/
18:46 < semilia> bbraun: that are the osx opensource parts not includign needed kext
18:46 < bbraun> semilia: you're not looking hard enough
18:47 < bbraun> look for the 'Binary' links.
18:47 < vmlemon> Isn't Darwin as shipped by Apple the darwinx86-801.iso supplied presently?
18:47 < semilia> wel llinks to opendarwin isos
18:48 < bbraun> yes
18:48 < bbraun> opendarwin isos are no longer available.  opendarwin is dead
18:48 -!- kvv [i=kvv@opendarwin/core/kvv] has joined #puredarwin
18:48 < semilia> well so i can use these bianry isos?
18:48 < vmlemon> Yes
18:49 < vmlemon> That gives you everything that is called as a whole "Darwin 8.0"
18:49 < vmlemon> and the binary bits
18:49 < bbraun> binary only kexts distributed with darwin are covered by the apple binary license included with darwin
18:50 < semilia> ok i have this iso already
18:51 < semilia> well a lot of things changed to latest distributed kernel source
18:51 < bbraun> yes, they have
18:52 < semilia> i wonder if the given binary will have any use
18:52 < bbraun> they will not work
18:52 < semilia> well i supposed they won't
18:52 < semilia> so much fun :)
18:53 < vmlemon> I guess that they allow distribution, but not modification or reverse-engineering (a subjective thing in different parts of the world)
18:53 < kvv> the Darwin 8.0.1 ISO has a different i386 ABI than the Darwin 8.9 sources
18:53 < bbraun> you can read the license
18:54 < kvv> the Darwin 8.0.1 ISO will boot on a generic PC, but the Darwin 8.9 sources, when built, probably require EFI
18:54 < semilia> kvv: let me build i am more concerned on none open source parts than that
18:54 < bbraun> darwin 8.9 sources will likely not get that far.  =)
18:55 < vmlemon> Will the Tianno Core FSW/OSS EFI emulation stuff be suitable with something like QEMU? I have the kit with an EFI ROM image and elilo-based Linux disk image
18:56 < bbraun> you'll likely have to experiement to see what exactly is required and what exactly is provided
18:56 < vmlemon> Of course, if one of us had access to an Apple x86 based machine, we could work these things out
18:56 < semilia> no tianocore will ahev no use as boot.efi si not opensource as well x-)
18:57 < semilia> well that is tricky action apple does there
18:57 < semilia> they only opensource stand alone unusable stuff
18:58 < vmlemon> As far as I know, the QEMU EFI ROM image that I have was compiled from an open source implementation, under what I believe to be the BSD or GPL license
18:58 < jgw> semilia: welcome to reality.
18:59 < semilia> vmlemon: i worked with tianocore before and well problem is get a efi bootloader to boot mach
18:59 < semilia> jgw: well gaps to be closed than :)
18:59 < kvv> Mach-O you mean
18:59 < semilia> well needed would be a driver for hfs+ first
19:00 < kvv> you could root on UFS
19:00 < vmlemon> That alone is a valid point, before they do anything else
19:00 < semilia> and a loader suiteable to boot mach (i call kernel like that even if iti is not "correct", excuse me :P )
19:00 < vmlemon> I'm going to try and reinstall Darwin and have a go at compiling the xnu-792.2.4 from 8.2
19:02 < probono> "kvv: the Darwin 8.0.1 ISO has a different i386 ABI than the Darwin 8.9 sources" - are these changes documented somewhere?
19:03 < bbraun> in the sources.  =)
19:04 < kvv> probono: the old i386 ABI isn't documented anywhere (that i know of, besides the sources), but the current i386 ABI is.
19:04 < vmlemon> Isn't Darwin/Mac OS X's flavour of UFS completely different somewhat from everyone else's? Which may complicate things
19:04 < bbraun> yes, it is different
19:04 < bbraun> but it isn't terrible to adapt an existing ufs implementation.
19:04 < vmlemon> and NeXTStep and Rhapsody's is very different, again
19:05 < probono> kvv: ok, thanks
19:05 < semilia> kvv: you think it is possibel apple would release darwin bianry kext for usage again?
19:05 < probono> or does the existing one continue to work?
19:06 < bbraun> the existing one will not continue to work
19:06 < bbraun> I'm doubting kvv can make any commitment as to what will and won't be released in the future
19:06 < probono> we are still talking about acpi.kext, right?
19:06 < bbraun> afaik, we are talking in the abstract of "binary kexts shipped with darwin"
19:06 < vmlemon> Isn't the idea behind PureDarwin to ship those components as is?
19:07 < vmlemon> Hence the name
19:07 < probono> the general philiosophy is to stay as "pure" as possible
19:07 < probono> and then go from there
19:07 < bbraun> if you work off the ppc sources, and use the existing binaries, you might have a better chance.
19:08 < semilia> btw. why is the i386 code in ppc sources updated?
19:09 < probono> bbraun: you are recommending this for getting a running x86 darwin that is Mac OS X i386 API compatible?
19:09 < bbraun> it will not be osx compatible
19:10 < bbraun> it is something that MIGHT get an updated darwin system running
19:10 < bbraun> instead of the basically impossible task of getting osx compatible x86 from the x86 sources running
19:12 < semilia> hmm i am master of zen if it comes to code :)
19:12 < probono> :)
19:15 < semilia> to stat clear what i don't want to do is some half hearted crap distribution aka gnudarwin clone
19:15 < probono> sorry, i just read the backlog. what i don't understand from the above is: if one took mac os x, deleted all files that are not part of the latest darwin, how exactly (in technical terms) would the result be different from a "pure darwin" compiled from source?
19:15 < vmlemon> I don't want to see it crippled, and without the components it should have
19:16 < probono> vmlemon: no one wants that
19:17 < vmlemon> Open Source Everything is nice, but to be realistic, it should ship with everything Apple provides, plus some (extra components to make a useful system like KDE or GNOME or IRC clients or such)
19:17 < semilia> easy going man :P before you can ship anything you need a base system
19:17 < semilia> whcih we not have yet
19:17 < bbraun> probono: 1) sources from apple are not guaranteed to be 1:1 with sources used to build osx, 2) darwin related components in OSX link against things that aren't in darwin, so clearly they can't do this in darwin, 3) you cannot reproduce the environment in which apple built mac os x
19:18 < semilia> and to be honest the 801 iso is indiscutable
19:18 < vmlemon> Base will be top priority for some time, I can tell, since the project is less than a week old (I think)
19:19 < probono> semilia: it is tradition that isos are only done for major releases, since they are extra work (dot needed in the regular os x production process)
19:19 < semilia> i meant using base of apple 801 bianry darwin
19:19 < probono> ah, i see
19:20 < probono> so the plan is to build from bare metal
19:20 < probono> xserve build clusternodes, anyone ;-)
19:20 -!- tritchey [n=tritchey@147.226.127.80] has joined #puredarwin
19:20 < vmlemon> The idea is to pick up from where Apple left off?
19:21 < probono> hi tritchey
19:21 < vmlemon> That place being the original 8.0 ISO
19:21 < semilia> the idea i ahve in mind is more to pick up where it shoudl be
19:21 < vmlemon> Same here
19:21 < kvv> you're going to need a Mac OS X system to build
19:21 < kvv> lots of projects have Xcode projects, not makefiles
19:21 < semilia> i have 4
19:21 < semilia> so we have no problem here :)
19:22 < vmlemon> A lot of drivers are XCode buildable only
19:22 < probono> that's why i mentioned xserve clusternodes ;-)
19:22 < mjhsieh> bbraun: so. can a theoretical future puredarwin binary be run on an x86 mac os X?
19:22 < kvv> there's really no reason for you to pay attention to the 8.0.1 ISO
19:22 < bbraun> mjhsieh: if by future puredarwin binary, you mean a darwin9 binary, assuming apple releases enough to make such a thing possible, then "maybe"
19:22  * probono thinks the entire pre-intelmac era is a whole different world
19:23 < jgw> probono: it is
19:23 < bbraun> mjhsieh: alternatively, puredarwin could reimplement many many key projects, and build and distribute a darwin8.x, then again, "maybe"
19:23 < vmlemon> It's New World (Open Firmware), and Old World preceded it
19:23 < semilia> the only problem for me so far in my sturcture is the missing of some important kext needed to be recreated in worst case on our won but well what is life without pain?
19:23 < probono> bbraun: that's not our understanding of "pure"
19:24 < bbraun> probono: ok, so what is the plan?
19:24 < mjhsieh> xcode should not be in the equation of "pure"
19:24 < vmlemon> We don't want to be another GNU Darwin, and replace everything for the hell of it
19:24 < probono> vmlemon, you're confusing 1 or 2 things :)
19:24 < probono> mjhsieh: the "pure" is about the resulting bits, not the build process
19:24 < probono> maybe i should add that to the wiki :-)
19:25 < vmlemon> The "replace everything for the hell of it" bit or the "We don't want to be another GNU Darwin" bit? ;)
19:25 -!- semilia|off [n=have@pd9e7f3f1.dip.t-dialin.net] has joined #puredarwin
19:25 < semilia|off> damn lien today
19:25 < probono> i mean, let's re-invent the wheels after we've built puerdarwin :)
19:25 < vmlemon> Reinventing The Square Wheel? ;)
19:25 < semilia|off> penta wheel i suggest
19:25 < probono> vmlemon: the old world/new world things. it refers to ppc entirely
19:25 < vmlemon> I know
19:26 < probono> ok
19:26 < vmlemon> I was merely giving a rough idea
19:26 < bbraun> he missing kexts and the binary compatibility are going to be the least of your problems once you actually try building things...
19:26 < jgw> is probono wwdcing this year?
19:26 < vmlemon> With just about all of the New Worlds being Open Firmware based
19:26 < probono> bbraun: the plan: from what we discussed here, i think the plan is to take 10.4.9 sources and compile them in xcode
19:26 < vmlemon> And distribute the resulting binaries
19:26 < probono> jgw: entirely no funds :(
19:27 < jgw> probono: sucky :(
19:27 < bbraun> probono: ok, and what are you expecting the outcome of such building will be?
19:28 < probono> bbraun: what do expect the outcome to be?
19:28 < vmlemon> The PureDarwin distribution - a product that intends to provide everything as Apple did, but make it better
19:28  * probono doesn't know how to answer this
19:28 < vmlemon> I think
19:28 < jgw> probono: why are you building the 10.4.9 sources? what do you expect?
19:28 < bbraun> I expect you'll have binaries that 1) won't boot, 2) won't run on existing darwin, and 3) by and large won't be useful for use on mac os x.
19:29 < probono> essentially to do what kvv does after each major release, but also for the minor releases.
19:29 -!- semilia [n=have@pD9E7F3F1.dip.t-dialin.net] has quit [Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)]
19:29 < probono> the thing that got all started was that i wondered why my 8.01 install refused to run wget from fink
19:30 < bbraun> well, if you believe you can actually do something like that after this conversation, all I can say is good luck.
19:30 < semilia|off> bbraun: you are to much focused on teh 801 stuff immo
19:30 < probono> so i wondered: what, there is no 3rdparty  binaries for darwin x86?
19:30 < bbraun> semilia|off: I'm not focused on it at all.
19:30 -!- semilia|off is now known as semilia
19:30 < probono> bbraun: no, i don't follow that 801 route anymore
19:30 < probono> that's the key learning of this # over the past days
19:30 < bbraun> correct, but how do you expect to boot your resultant binaries?
19:31 < bbraun> and do you expect it to boot on non-macx86 systems?
19:31 < probono> absolutely
19:31 < bbraun> how do you plan to accomplish that?
19:31 < semilia> with a bootloader
19:31 < semilia> :P
19:31 < vmlemon> With time and dedication, most likely
19:31  * probono points to the line above
19:31 < bbraun> considering you have no boot code, and several missing drivers key to actually booting the system
19:31 < probono> no boot loader?
19:32 < probono> doesn't the old one do it?
19:32 < vmlemon> It's worth a try
19:32 < bbraun> the old one boots the new kernel?
19:32 < mjhsieh> bbraun: I think that chain0 still works in someway
19:32 < semilia> bbraun: you do os development?
19:33 < probono> that's agood one ;-) lol
19:33 < bbraun> mjhsieh: right, and chain1 should still work, but chain2 shouldn't
19:33 < bbraun> semilia: I've been known to do some here and there.  ;)
19:33 < semilia> even writing a new bootloader in worst case is nothing scary :o
19:34 < probono> i've looked at it, it's not _that_ large a clunk of code actually
19:34 < vmlemon> What about altering GRUB or *lilo?
19:34 < probono> not "pure"
19:34 < bbraun> you have the information you need to write one?
19:34 < probono> but fallback
19:34 < probono> the source of the old one, bbraun
19:34 < bbraun> and do you plan on accomplishing this before october?
19:34 < probono> now that's a good question
19:34 < bbraun> probono: if the source of the old one worked, you wouldn't need to write a new one
19:34 < probono> however irrelevant
19:35  * probono didn't say we need a new one
19:35 < vmlemon> Time Will Tell
19:35 < vmlemon> It's still a very young project
19:35 < probono> bbraun: the october question is irrelevant because the next minor update will come in november :-)
19:35 < semilia> bbraun: why october?
19:35 < bbraun> indeed it will, but I'm looking for even the seed of a plan
19:36 < bbraun> semilia: because it is possible and from experience, probable that all of the work to get 10.4.x building and booting will be irrelevant when 10.5 comes out
19:36 < probono> all? come on
19:36 < probono> that'd be crazy, apple devs would go insane
19:37 < bbraun> who's the one that actually has done multiple darwin releases here?  ;-)
19:37 < probono> heh :)
19:37 < mjhsieh> probono: practically no one will care about 10.4 after 10.5 release
19:37 < bbraun> apple devs don't go insane because 1) they're paid to work on it full time, and 2) they have a year+ to do everything
19:37 < bbraun> and 3) there are hundreds of them
19:37 < semilia> well porting back parts of 1049 mod to 105 will be spossible and if anything gets removed, code existed already so ...
19:37 < bbraun> well, they go insane, but for different reasons.  =)
19:37 < probono> ;)
19:38 < vmlemon> And finally, to achieve World Domination (R)? ;)
19:38 < bbraun> ok, ok.  clearly, I don't understand something, so I'll let y'all get back to it.  Don't want to hold up progress and all.
19:38 < semilia> moon is a poitn to start of with domination :P
19:39 < vmlemon> It would be a good idea to draw up a roadmap
19:39 < vmlemon> If we haven't done so already
19:39 < probono> bbraun: basically we love to do this stuff, that's pretty much it
19:39 < semilia> vmlemon: there is one til the point a bse system is usable and up
19:39 < mjhsieh> bbraun: I can imagine that the 10.5 tree branched out from 10.4 since the final beta
19:39 < mjhsieh> so there is a year of differences
19:44 < vmlemon> probono: Do we have a suggested Testing Platform? Is it VMware, QEMU/Bochs, real hardware or whatever works best?
19:45 < semilia> for the entry developemnt i already have anything setup here
19:47 < mjhsieh> well, probably you guys need some help from the dark side (well russian side...)
19:47 < probono> vmlemon: probably as much diverse hardware as we can get our hands on
19:48 < probono> mjhsieh: this is intended to be a 100% cleanroom exercise
19:48 < vmlemon> I know we're focusing on x86 mainly, though, but I have some PowerPC hardware here that may come in use sometime later if at all
19:49 < vmlemon> I'm willing to sacrifice the Linux install on my laptop, too for a Darwin installatio
19:49 < vmlemon> +n
19:49 < probono> vmlemon: bbraun usually tends to point out that some things are dead ;)
19:49 < vmlemon> OK
19:49 < semilia> well maybe wait with that for a tiny base
19:49 < semilia> and use vmware or qemu with a drive iso
19:50 < vmlemon> I've been doing everything with VMware, up until now
19:51 < probono> hence, vmlemon?
19:52 < vmlemon> Well, it was one of the reasons why I have that nick, but it's mainly because I'd used it somewhere else and started using it on other sites, so it pretty much stuck
19:53 < vmlemon> It doesn't mean anything though, and it's just something random that I thought of at the time
19:55 < vmlemon> It's mainly so I don't have to reinvent the wheel and be stuck with a dozen random username
19:55 < vmlemon> *usernames
19:56 < probono> sure
19:57 < probono> interesting puredarwin bashing over at od.
19:57 < vmlemon> It'd be nice to see decent read+write support for UDF on Darwin
19:57 < probono> quote:
19:57 < vmlemon> They're bashing us already?
19:58 < probono> bbraun: So although I think the puredarwin folks are attempting the impossible, and I honestly truly don't think it is possible to accomplish what they're trying to do, and are foolish for believing they can, I guess there is some small chance they could pull it off

20:17 < bbraun> no connection problem, my client seems to lockup whenver we talk about rule #1 of puredarwin
20:17 < probono> must be a great rule then :)
20:17 < bbraun> heh
20:18 < probono> we should keep it, what do you think?
20:18 < vmlemon> I call Fnords ;)
20:18 < vmlemon> They're eating the rule
20:18 < bbraun> I really am interested in whatever that is
20:18 < bbraun> it could be one of my irssi scripts
20:18 < vmlemon> Should I paste the quote into here?
20:18 < bbraun> or it could be a bug in irssi
20:19 < bbraun> no, paste it in lisppaste or something
20:19 < probono> vmlemon: the rule shall not be posted ;)

20:20 < probono> vmlemon: forgot to add the source to it
20:20 < vmlemon> OK
20:20 < probono> bbraun: heard that before?
20:20 < probono> bbraun: ...
20:20 < probono> bbraun: ?
20:21 < vmlemon> I've updated it at http://pastebin.ca/448590
20:21  * semilia is working on a testsetup and stuff if anything intresting is happening call me :P
20:21 < probono> on your red phone?
20:21 < vmlemon> The Big Brown Phone, probably
20:22 < bbraun> ok, going to go play with that url

20:22 < vmlemon> Zune drivers for PureDarwin, anyone? ;)
20:23 < jgw> non-vaporware for puredarwin, anyone?
20:23 < vmlemon> hah
20:24 < vmlemon> The difference is, it won't be vapour
20:24 < jgw> psh
20:24 < vmlemon> it will be liquid
20:24 < jgw> we'll see
20:24 < probono> packages.* isn't
20:25 < jgw> probono: uh?
20:25 < probono> pd is 50% about documenting and 50% about creating
20:25 < probono> if we fail with either half, there is still the other :)
20:25 < probono> it's called "hedging"
20:26 < jgw> documenting darwin is probably worthwhile
20:27 < jgw> creating a darwin distribution is niche at best
20:27 < jgw> but who knows. we seem to have a lot of darwin folks joining #opendarwin
20:27 < jgw> seems like at least one per day. granted, they're mostly software pirates, but
20:27 < vmlemon> There's always a TRON Association style setup, where everything is documented and the user/developer creates a distro from it
20:27 < jgw> err a lot of folks interested in darwin, not "darwin folks"
20:27 < vmlemon> and there's no product as such (other than the specs for building it)
20:28 < vmlemon> I really want to see a PureDarwin distro, though
20:28  * probono likes usable stuff
20:29 < vmlemon> If there was no PureDarwin to "supersede" it, I would have probably tried to build a Darwin distribution but would have failed on the infrastructure
20:30 < vmlemon> and the whole thing would be a waste of time, and probably wouldn't work ;)
20:30 < vmlemon> I have a lot of faith in PureDarwin, though
20:38 < semilia> intresting darwin 801 dislikes Q lol
20:38 < probono> it crashes parallels even worse
20:39 < semilia> in fusion it works
20:40 < semilia> but fiusion sucks as it does not want to let me select my hfs+ disk system in a file i made :-o

21:43 < vmlemon> OK
21:57 -!- semilia [n=have@pd9e7f3f1.dip.t-dialin.net] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
22:31 < jgw> yes, but does it support IPv5?!
22:31 < vmlemon> hah
22:31 < vmlemon> IPv5 was an expermental protocol for video delivery that was never released or used
22:32 < vmlemon> Of course, it does IPv4 really well, as should most OSes
22:32 < jgw> it wasnt for video delivery.
22:32 < jgw> at all.
22:32 < vmlemon> Wasn't it?
22:32 < jgw> no.
22:33 < jgw> when you read the wikipedia article next time, think "stream" as in TCP ;)
22:33 < vmlemon> It was more like SCTP?
22:33 -!- semilia|off [n=have@pD9E7F2AE.dip.t-dialin.net] has joined #puredarwin
22:35 < jgw> apparently ST2, the next rev was targeted towards the possibility of video transmissions
22:36 < vmlemon> OK
22:36 < jgw> i hope ipv6 like, becomes a reality some day
22:36 < jgw> i want a raw ipv6 connection where i have to use an ipv4 gateway ;)
22:37 < vmlemon> It's real and it's here, except ISPs probably don't want to offer it to customers
22:37 < vmlemon> It'd be nice when they hand out an IPv6 address with the next IPv4 address that they hand out
22:38 < jgw> yeah i ran on the 6bone for a long time
22:38 < jgw> and we have a box on abilene that sits and transmits a video stream 24/7
22:39 < jgw> well ISPs offering it to their customers involves the nightmare of upgrading their network hardware's firmware and configs and then providing support for it
22:39 < jgw> but yeah it'd be nice
22:39 < vmlemon> The only IPv6 connectivity I get is via a tunnel broker (UK6x), and it's a pain to use with a dynamic IP address
22:39 < jgw> i think that eventually it will be seamless
22:40 < jgw> i'd really like to see the ipv4 proxy scenario
22:40 < jgw> (kinda like 6bone, but the other way around)
22:40 < vmlemon> NAT was what really slowed the uptake of it, though
22:40 < jgw> yeah agreed
22:40 < vmlemon> And caused people hell for other things, too
22:40 < vmlemon> (and still does)

16:12 < vmlemon> Hi, where did all the wiki go?
16:13 < probono> hi vmlemon
16:14 < probono> it's temporarily suspended since it only resulted in people making fun of us
16:14 < vmlemon> How come? There's nothing wrong with the wiki
16:20 < probono> vmlemon: we're focusing on compiling xnu atm
16:20 < probono> Singh chapter 6.10 discusses the steps needed to build xnu, specifically compiling the pre-requisites. He recommends using DarwinBuild at the end of the chapter.
16:20 < probono> http://www.nabble.com/Building-Intel-xnu-with-darwinbuild-t2143376.html (to be verified and updated)
16:20 < probono> http://opendarwin.org/projects/darwinbuild/doc/build/index.html and http://opendarwin.org/projects/darwinbuild/doc/tools/index.html (Where will this be hosted after OpenDarwin closes, should we wikify it?)
16:20 < vmlemon> Good Idea
16:20 < vmlemon> What about the DarwinBuild software itself?
16:21 < probono> is available from macosforge
16:21 < vmlemon> OK
16:22 < vmlemon> Want me to save archive copies of those 3 pages until they're needed, just in case the worst should happen?
16:24 < probono> i guess they're on archive.org, but it can't hurt
17:22 < jgw> probono: you should probably mirror just about everything you can from the opendarwin.org website
17:22 < jgw> bbraun could get crufty and it could go down tomorrow ;)
17:23 < probono> hopefully he ships me the backups or even gives me the then-free server ;)
17:24 < probono> is the ">console" user supposed to work in 10.4.9?
17:24 < probono> only gives me a cursor but no login prompt :(
17:28 -!- probono [n=user@p549DB6B1.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] has quit []
17:48 < vmlemon> jgw: I'm collecting stuff from it
17:48 < vmlemon> (at least what's left of it)
17:50 < vmlemon> Do we want stuff like OpenAudio and osx2x and such? Or have they moved on?
17:51 < jgw> that stuffs all dead iirc
17:51 < vmlemon> OK
17:52 < jgw> but i am not an authority on anything there
17:52 < jgw> there was a flurry of projects started surrounding OD/Darwin that never really took off
17:52 < vmlemon> And just used ODo for storage and hosting?
17:52 < jgw> bbraun is pretty much THE authority on *, here
17:56 < vmlemon> Do we know if ISC will ever cut off the air supply to opendarwin.org, as so to speak? It's been around for much longer than envisioned after the closure
17:56 < jgw> again, i am not qualified to respond, but i believe ISC does jackshit
17:56 < jgw> one sec, lemme ask bbraun

17:58 -!- bbraun [n=bbraun@opendarwin/core/bbraun] has joined #puredarwin
17:59 < jgw>  < vmlemon> Do we know if ISC will ever cut off the air supply to
17:59 < jgw>                     opendarwin.org, as so to speak? It's been around for much
17:59 < jgw>                     longer than envisioned after the closure
17:59 < jgw> bah.
18:00 < bbraun> isc will not forcibly turn of od, I don't think.  However, we would like it turned off and the machine removed within 10 days.  In all probability, this won't happen, and the machine will be pulled while I'm in town for wwdc
18:00 < bbraun> services will gradually be turned off between now and then though
18:01 < bbraun> 3 of the 4 od machines, including the cvs repository have already been removed from service.
18:01 < vmlemon> ISC holds the opendarwin.org domain's rights? Or does that belong to Apple? Or the defunct project?
18:01 < bbraun> I personally own the domain.
18:02 < vmlemon> OK
18:02 -!- probono [n=user@p549DB6B1.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] has joined #puredarwin
18:02 < semilia|off> :)
18:02 < vmlemon> Any ideas what lead to it's untimely demise? Or is that something that we'll never know?
18:03 < vmlemon> *events
18:03 < bbraun> Apple owns the physical machines opendarwin runs on.  They have apple property tags, but that is the extent of apple's involvement and claims on opendarwin.
18:03 < bbraun> vmlemon: other than what has already been extensively documented here, in the writings on my web page, and on the od web page?
18:03 < vmlemon> Yes
18:03 < vmlemon> I'll go and look at them, too
18:04 < vmlemon> Or is that everything we know?
18:04 < bbraun> those things about cover it.  If you have any specific questions, I'd be glad to answer them.  "why it died" is a big ambiguous and has been ranted about at length.  I'm sure people don't want to rehash it again.  =)
18:05 < probono> http://opendarwin.org/projects/darwinbuild/doc/build/index.html and http://opendarwin.org/projects/darwinbuild/doc/tools/index.html (Where will this be hosted after OpenDarwin closes, should we wikify it?)
18:05 < jgw> again, you should probably mirror anything of value
18:05 < semilia|off> i have already mirrored whole opendarwin org x-)
18:05 < bbraun> I personally have no plans to host any content currently on opendarwin.org once it dies.  Beyond some of my personal effects in ~bbraun/
18:05 < semilia|off> and darwinsource and ...
18:06 < bbraun> darwinsource.opendarwin is a mirror of www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource
18:06 < probono> yes, but google code spidered
18:06 < probono> unlike apple's
18:06 < semilia|off> i have mirrored any minor subdowmain of opendarwin.org 1:1
18:06 < probono> good :)
18:07 < bbraun> if you wish to mirror things, much is available via rsync://rsync.opendarwin.org, but not all
18:07 < probono> semilia|off: i have setup my build machine, so the fun can begin soon
18:07 < probono> next to me is the singh bible :)
18:07 < semilia|off> i have that
18:08 < semilia|off> nice book too much ppc
18:08 < vmlemon> I'm alright if there's nothing more to say about it's demise, but I'm curious, of course, being a fairly latecomer to Darwin
18:09 < vmlemon> Do I have a habit of jumping on the back of something just before it fails? ;)
18:09 < bbraun> I'm sure you will encounter many of the same problems opendarwin has encountered.  They've been explained, but some things need to be experienced to be understood.
18:09 < vmlemon> OK
18:10 < bbraun> I explained many of the technical problems here, and the general consensus was I was being overly negative and unsupportive.  I have explained some of the socilogical problems, and was told I was wrong.  So...
18:11 < probono> bbraun: we din't think badly about you
18:11 < probono> at all
18:11 < probono> in fact we appreciate that someone has warned us ni advance, so we can't become too frustrated in the end
18:11 < jgw> bbraun: perhaps it is your english, but it sounded like such
18:11 < jgw> err
18:12 < jgw> probono: perhaps it is your english, but it sounded like such
18:12 < bbraun> It doesn't matter to me, it's just that I have tried to explain some of the problems, and you do not perceive them as problems.
18:12 < vmlemon> As a young project, we need all the assets/resources we can get, and I'm sure others agree
18:12 < bbraun> I do.
18:12 < jgw> vmlemon: i think your problem will be finding an audience
18:12 < probono> maybe we're just a bit stubborn :)
18:13 < jgw> vmlemon: i dont see the viability of a Darwin without OS X, being as there are a plethora of much better options out there (such as virtually all of Darwin's competitors)
18:13 < probono> anyway, turning to page 677 :)
18:13 < vmlemon> jgw: Well, that's true, and it's not easy to gain traction for something as large as an operating system
18:13 < vmlemon> But it could work, given time and chance
18:13 < jgw> Darwin is inferior to Linux and most BSDs imho
18:13 < bbraun> I was merely asked what the problems were with opendarwin, and I've already explained them, they just weren't perceived as problems here.  So, I'm not sure asking what the problems were again makes much sense.  Specific questions might be more useful.
18:14 < jgw> vmlemon: but you depend on apple, and apple will not give a flying fuck about you
18:14 < jgw> vmlemon: even though specific applers such as kvv may provide passing assistance
18:14 < probono> jgw: are you involved with bsd?
18:14 < jgw> probono: i used to be
18:15 < probono> freebsd?
18:15 < jgw> yeah
18:15 < vmlemon> I'm not the leader, but of course, as a project, we need the source that Apple makes available, and it would cause problems should cease to be made available
18:15 < vmlemon> *should the source cease to be made available
18:15 < probono> there are some aspects of dragonfly that i find interesting
18:15 < jgw> i think its very likely that apple could stop distributing the source
18:16 < probono> but not if there is a vibrant, interested, welcoming, active, darwin community
18:16 < probono> :)
18:16 < jgw> apple, as a corporation has a responsibility to shareholders, and i dont see them investing precious resources into an unprofitable venture of open sourceness
18:16 < vmlemon> Which is one of the things that PureDarwin is trying to build
18:16 < vmlemon> As well as the end product, and presumably process
18:16 < jgw> people will still gobble up macs whether xnu is open source or not
18:16 < probono> jgw: and publicity relates 1:1 to that
18:16 < bbraun> For opendarwin, it was always uncertain what would and wouldn't be available in the next source drop, or if a next source drop would occur.  Apple has made no promises (although has created an expectation) to continue providing sources.  And since apple's official stance is to not comment on future releases, planning for the next release is impossible.
18:17 < jgw> bbraun++
18:17 < jgw> and puredarwin's goals remain nebulous
18:17 < jgw> yes, i know its a 50/50 project
18:17 < vmlemon> I haven't worked with Apple, but I know that they can be very secretive about things
18:18 < jgw> but i'm not asking about what you guys want to accomplish, but what are you goals?
18:18 < jgw> what do you hope to affect?
18:18 < jgw> vmlemon: s/can be/are/
18:19 < jgw> the best you can do is acquire a pay-for adc account and download OS betas and examine them
18:19 < jgw> (without source)
18:19 < probono> jgw: the project goals have been removed from the site because they only invited people to make fun of us
18:19 < jgw> probono: but what do you WANT?
18:19 < jgw> you want a darwin kernel-based OS
18:19 < probono> have a usable darwin system & ecosystem
18:19 < jgw> that's not Mac OS X
18:20 < jgw> now why Darwin, and not Linux or *BSD?
18:20 < probono> personal preference
18:20 < jgw> why not just use OS X and strip it down? heh
18:20 < jgw> why not just use OS X?
18:20 < vmlemon> Why Darwin? In my opinion, it's Not Linux or *BSD, and it does have some interesting things
18:20 < probono> not avail for >90% of machines out there
18:20 < jgw> vmlemon: but Darwin isnt that great
18:21 < jgw> its neat, yes, but
18:21 < jgw> probono: ok valid point
18:21 < jgw> not available for >90% machines out there
18:21 < vmlemon> Hacking it to run on non Apple hardware is not exactly practical or legal
18:21 < bbraun> There is an article I wrote for demonnews back in 2000 or so, which sounds remarkably like the feelings of those involved in puredarwin.
18:21 < bbraun> It may be interesting for you to see the opinions I started with.  =)
18:22 < vmlemon> It's Different, and it still has potential, which we are trying to unlock
18:22 < bbraun> I cannot deny that it has potential.  That is one of the things that got me involved with darwin, macosx, and became an apple employee
18:25 < probono> :)
18:25 < jgw> i'm pretty biased in that i dislike Darwin a lot
18:25 < jgw> Darwin/xnu/IOKit
18:25 < vmlemon> I'm interested in the technology and implementation in it
18:26 < jgw> bbraun: is that daemonnews article posted on your website?
18:26 < bbraun> prolly not, I'll try to find it
18:26 < probono> bbraun: my calculations show that the intel switch should account for a 50x increase in installed base & potential devs
18:26 < jgw> http://ezine.daemonnews.org/200010/darwin.html
18:26 < probono> that'll make the difference
18:26 < jgw> that's it, i think
18:26 < bbraun> yeah, that looks like it
18:27 < jgw> didnt know daemonnews still existed, heh
18:27 < bbraun> probono: possibly.  Although my personal opinion is that doesn't matter.
18:28 < probono> bbraun: you really should not get the impression that we don't respect or like your work
18:28 < jgw> bbraun: did apple start out with the openstep kernel and upgrade it? or did they start from "scratch" and integrate mach and bsd, and then tack on stuff from openstep?
18:28  * jgw boggles and fitting freebsd, mach, and iokit crap together
18:28 < probono> heh, "I find IOKit to be exceptionally cool."
18:29 < jgw> probono: i still dispute your audience
18:29 < bbraun> don't get me wrong.  people liking or respecting my work or me, or not liking it doesn't affect me at all.  And I honestly harbor no ill will towards this project.
18:29 < jgw> probono: i dont think you'll have much of an audience
18:29 < vmlemon> I'm amazed that glomming 2 different kernels together can produce a working system, but Mach was derived from BSD at some point in the line, so it makes sense
18:29 < jgw> probono: but then again, take linus torvalds, when i started using linux, the linux crowd was not even a crowd, and see where he's gone with it now
18:30 < jgw> so i guess i should shut up ;)
18:30 < vmlemon> I guess the GPL had more to do with Linux's success, at the time?
18:30 < jgw> i dont believe so
18:31 < jgw> i think it kept things together over time, but
18:31 < vmlemon> There is no doubting that Linux has pretty much taken off
18:31 < jgw> linux has more than taken off, it has established a firm foundation
18:31 < jgw> its not a niche OS by any means, except on the desktop
18:31 < vmlemon> It is getting better on the desktop, day by day, at least as I see it
18:32 < probono> oh yeah, and with every .0.01 kernel update i have to rebuild by graphics drivers. clearly superior
18:32 < jgw> i mainly deal with linux on servers and embedded arm devices, though
18:32 < probono> only because they want no stable kernel apis
18:32 < vmlemon> I remember trying to configure Red Hat back in 2000 or so, and I gave up after failing with it more times than enough
18:32 < jgw> they have stable APIs
18:32 < jgw> and you dont need to update every little update
18:32 < jgw> if you do, you have to accept those issues
18:33 < vmlemon> A couple of years went by, and I decided to revisit it, and I'm still using it now
18:33 < jgw> staying bleeding edge on linux is a messy affair
18:33 < vmlemon> So it has grown a lot, over the last few years, even in the last 7 years or so
18:34 < jgw> greg kroah hartman wrote an excellent article on the linux abi/api myths
18:34 < jgw> but i cant seem to find it
18:35 < jgw> vmlemon: i am not a red hat fan
18:35 < jgw> vmlemon: i enjoy fedora core for experimentation, though
18:35 < jgw> using it for anything production frustrates me
18:35 < vmlemon> I use Gentoo at the moment, and moved to it from Ubuntu last year
18:35 < bbraun> heh.  re-reading this daemonnews article is funny.  The closing question "How will darwin fare once Mac OS X is released?".  Apparently, very poorly.  =)
18:35 < vmlemon> Hmm
18:36  * probono has this greg person as his fav example of end-user-disorientation
18:36 < jgw> probono: hmm?
18:37 < probono> this greg type philosophy is going nowhere, it's far too centralistic
18:37 < vmlemon> Greg type?
18:37 < probono> not only monolithic kernel, but monolitic driver universe
18:37 < probono> awfully flawed reasoning
18:38 < jgw> err which of his philosophies?
18:38 < probono> why all drivers should be developed in a centralistic way inside the linux tree
18:38 < vmlemon> Maybe they're too busy riding hype to actually think about things? ;)
18:38 < jgw> he is a bit of a gpl bigot, but not in the usual annoying nerd hippy, loud-mouthed way
18:38 < bbraun> Once I write bbraunos, then I'll criticize.
18:38 < jgw> but gkh is a good guy, very prolific
18:39 < jgw> he takes more of the "this is how it is, i'm doing it this way" guy, somehow without being too confrontational
18:39 < probono> probably an excellent coder but not a visionary
18:39 < jgw> i can agree with that
18:40 < jgw> although he's more of a visionary than i am, so who am i to criticize? :)
18:40 < jgw> the most vision i have is what i'm going to do tonight (drink beer at the pub and eat greasy food)
18:41 < jgw> probono: i guess for all the criticisms and huge odds against your success, stranger things have happened
18:41 < bbraun> vision without execution is worse than execution without vision.  =)
18:41 < vmlemon> I'm sure some of us have wanted to Reinvent The (Square) Wheel, and hammer out a new kernel and OS (presumably to be a better Linux than Linux or something like that)
18:42 < bbraun> better yet, I've started.  ;-)
18:42 < jgw> vmlemon: i suspect that the more tangible results you produce, the more likely someone at apple will pay attention to you and offer some form of minimal assistance
18:43 < probono> yes
18:43  * probono will only engage in technical discussions for the next time
18:43 < jgw> the whole darwin thing is depressing though
18:43 < bbraun> jgw: only for those of us who have lived it.  They're just starting.  Haven't had time & experience to have their spirits crushed yet.  =)
18:44 < jgw> Apple had a community of passionate people who wanted to devote significant parts of their own time and they shit on them, imho
18:44 < bbraun> of the original darwin crew, almost all the regulars were hired by apple.  Of those, kvv is the only one still working at apple, I believe.
18:45 < vmlemon> I had a roadmap and vision for C10 (an OS project I've thought of for a while), but the lack of ability to start writing it and what I'm sure is probably over ambition is making sure it's not coming off the ground
18:45 -!- snu [n=finlay@unaffiliated/snu] has joined #puredarwin
18:45 < snu> wow
18:45 < snu> ther eare actually people here?
18:45 < jgw> vmlemon: you gain the ability to start writing it by starting to write it :)
18:45 < jgw> one line at a time
18:45 < snu> what happened to the wiki? :(
18:46 < vmlemon> I'm still learning Perl, and I don't know any C/C++ or assembler
18:46 < bbraun> snu: you were too mean
18:46 < jgw> vmlemon: int main( void) { and go from there
18:46 < snu> bbraun: eh?
18:46 < vmlemon> You can't do an OS in Perl, though ;)
18:46 < jgw> DARWIN PORN STATION
18:46 < snu> vmlemon: what?
18:46 < snu> jgw: what?
18:46 < jgw> vmlemon: you can model ideas in perl
18:46 < vmlemon> Well, true
18:46 < snu> you could do an OS in Perl.
18:46 < bbraun> actually, there is no reason you can't do an os in perl
18:46 < jgw> and thats better than nothing
18:47  * snu ^5's bbraun
18:47 < jgw> pernel!
18:47 < vmlemon> Most of my concepts are large text documents with ASCII art and various thoughts scattered in them 
18:47 < snu> it would be a more interesting intellectual exercise than puredarwin.
18:47 < bbraun> but anyway.  way too much blather, not enough on topic discussion.
18:48 < vmlemon> One of my concepts was something called fakehw, but if it'll ever work is another matter, even though I've built directory trees and documented what goes where
18:49 < vmlemon> To quote part of the README I wrote, "fakehw will be designed so that almost any hardware device can be emulated and manipulated in a manner that's transparent to both the user, and the system."
18:49 < jgw> i think this goes back to bbraun's vision vs. action
18:49 < jgw> vmlemon: fakehw == HAL :)
18:50 < jgw> vmlemon: every OS has a HAL
18:50 < jgw> err modern OS
18:50 < jgw> HAL, driver APIs, etc
18:50 < vmlemon> I guess it's a Wheel Reinvented HAL+ with hardware emulation for bits that aren't inside the box as real hardware
18:51 < jgw> woot, jumping off the success of winmodems!
18:51 < vmlemon> "dummynics contains "bit-bucket"/dummy NIC drivers for Ethernet, Asyncronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Token Ring and other network media types over a fake NIC interface for each one (nodes in /dev/net/ether/*(a-z), /dev/net/atm/*(a-z), /dev/net/tokr/*(a-z) and so on)."
18:51 < bbraun> speaking of vision, the future isn't the OS, it's the hypervisor
18:51 < vmlemon> Probably already done, so I'm Reinventing The Wheel (TM) :/
18:52 < jgw> vmlemon: indeed
18:52 < jgw> vmlemon: you suffer from the same fault i have
18:52 < vmlemon> NIH?
18:52 < vmlemon> Or vision and action problem?
18:53 < jgw> discovering pre-existing ideas and trying to do things on your own without checking for similar works already implemented
18:53 < jgw> for me, its astrophysics and log analysis
18:53 < jgw> "why are planets spherical?"
18:53 < jgw> or how do i generate stats from logfiles?
18:54 < jgw> i'm too dumb to actually research what people have done prior, i sit and get headaches thiking up my own concepts
18:54 < vmlemon> I'm starting to doubt if the InfiniBand adapter + protocol emulation would require too many resources to emulate, since it was designed for fast systems, but in my model, it's Just Another Network Protocol
18:54 < jgw> isnt infiniband dead? ;)
18:54 < jgw> or dying
18:55 < vmlemon> I guess that mapping USB buses to network devices isn't new, either (mapping then to /dev/net/usb/0 for example)
18:55 < bbraun> jgw: not really.  10gige would kill it, but 10gige adapters are basically all super fast fpgas at this point, no commodity chipsets yet
18:55 < jgw> i know its used for clustering and for Dell's SAS crap
18:56 < jgw> The object oriented nature of IOKit also reduces redundant code and simplifies driver development.
18:56 < jgw> do you still believe that?
18:57 < bbraun> the problem with infiniband is it is not suited for generic networking.  Running things like iscsi or other IP based, packetized traffic over it performs poorly.  Better than gige, but no where near line speed.  To take advantage of infiniband, you have to code to infiniband
18:57 < vmlemon> I'm again RIvTW, if I make my own kernel, when I could in theory modify Linux
18:57 < vmlemon> And things like OS personalities aren't new, either, so that rules another thing out
18:58 < bbraun> jgw: I've done a lot more OO since then, and I don't believe OO reduces code.  It reduces complex code, but adds HUGE amounts of glue code
18:59 < bbraun> and as for iokit in particular, you bump up against the edges of iokit/bsd/mach too much.  Adding a new networking protocol requires haxoring all three sections plus their glue code.
18:59 < bbraun> at least, a link layer protocol.  I tried to add CHDLC for a DS3 card I wrote the linux drivers for.  Ugh.
18:59 < jgw> vmlemon: linux is somewhat chaotic, but it is by no means crappy
19:00 < snu> jgw: solaris is less chaotic.
19:00 < jgw> vmlemon: and by that i'm speaking at the kernel/system level
19:00 < jgw> not distributions
19:00 < jgw> snu: true and i hope opensolaris will grab a foothold
19:00 < vmlemon> I don't think Linux is crappy, it's great in fact, but some of my ideas might not fit into the Linux design, or are already being thought about :( 
19:01 < jgw> it will be interesting to see where kernels and the concept of an OS goes, in the future
19:01 < snu> jgw: opensolaris ftw!
19:01 < bbraun> OS research has been dead for over 10yrs
19:01 < vmlemon> I guess C10 is and was a stillborn :(
19:01 < jgw> bbraun: no way man
19:01 < bbraun> way.
19:02 < jgw> bbraun: its just been focusing on security ;)
19:02 < bbraun> bolting on security to existing os'
19:02 < bbraun> that's not os research imo
19:05 < vmlemon> Still, I could hammer on pkginfo, and keep on reinventing the wheel on that
19:05 < bbraun> I prefer reinventing my wheels from the ground up.
19:06 < jgw> vmlemon: you could always start a mac packages project :)
19:06 < bbraun> start with the archive format, extensible for building package managers, then build the package manager, then build the build environment.
19:06 < vmlemon> jgw: And work my pkginfo file format into that?
19:06 < vmlemon> Yay, RIvTWing the idea of a package repository
19:07 < bbraun> 80s style
19:07 < vmlemon> My format is closer to XML
19:07  * bbraun puts on a pair of aviators
19:08 < jgw> vmlemon: xar
19:10 < vmlemon> http://pastebin.ca/450234 if anyone wants to see an example of my Wheel Reinvented software packaging format
19:12 < bbraun> I decieded I didn't like path separators, so I made each path element an xml node
19:12 < snu> hehe.
19:13 < vmlemon> You can have a different pathstyle property for each <PkgItem> tag, to accomodate things like Macintosh and Windows paths
19:13 < bbraun> yes, but what happens when you have a path that has both styles?
19:14 < vmlemon> Nothing happens, you create a new PkgItem for the file with a different pathstyle property
19:15 < vmlemon> In case of conflict, only the first is used, and the duplicate is ignored
19:16 < bbraun> instead of having a path style, just specify the field separator, so you can have one path parsing implementation that takes the separator as an argument so you can support arbitrary path styles without needing foreknowledge of everything everyone will want to use?
19:16 < vmlemon> Without forcing it, it should automatically detect the platform and only install the files with the right pathstyle
19:16 < bbraun> so <PkgItem type="directory" ifs="/">/foo/bar</PkgItem>
19:20 < vmlemon> if <PkgItem type="file" pathstyle="Macintosh">$DEFAULT_DRIVE:System Folder:Extensions</PkgItem> is used for example, the other items will be ignored unless the user tries to explicitly force an installation of them
19:20 < vmlemon> Your idea might work, I don't know. And I haven't built a working model of my system as it is
19:22 < bbraun> xml handles the idea of hierarchy, so I figured why have a hierarchy not represented in the native representation, especially when it simplifies things.  Already need to parse the xml.
19:23 < vmlemon> I'm not designing towards "true XML", and I've tried other designs that are closer to it, and my idea is mainly striving towards simplicity for the developer to read and create the files and the user to install and potentially alter them
19:24 < vmlemon> It's a good idea to revisit things, though
19:25 < bbraun> xml or no, your system clearly has the concept of heirarchy in it.
19:25 < vmlemon> Well, true
19:25 < probono> when building cctools/libstuff, it complains that it can't find ar.h
19:26 < probono> it's there though, in ../../xnu-792.18.15/EXTERNAL_HEADERS/ar.h
19:26 < probono> how do i tell it to use that?
19:26 < bbraun> how are you building cctools, and which cctools are you using?
19:26 < probono> latest cctools for x86
19:26 < bbraun> and how are you building it?
19:26 < probono> cd ../cctools-622.5.1/
19:26 < probono> cd libstuff/
19:26 < probono> make
19:27 < snu> you're an idiot
19:27 < probono> who
19:27 < snu> you
19:27 < probono> why
19:27 < snu> use darwinbuild
19:27 < probono> ah, that's why
19:27 < bbraun> I would recommend using darwinbuild.  if you don't want to use darwinbuild, I'd recommend looking at how darwinbuild builds things.
19:27 < snu> yes, that too
19:27 < probono> ok, but:
19:28 < probono> new != idiot
19:28 < probono> ;)
19:28 < snu> investing effort in darwin = idiot
19:28 < snu> ;)
19:28 < bbraun> if you are not using darwinbuild, you'll have to build up a development environment.  A stock OSX system will not be sufficient.
19:29 < probono> then singh's chapter is crap
19:29 < snu> singh has a chapter on this?
19:29 < bbraun> I do not have singh's chapter to refer to.
19:29 < probono> chapter 6.10
19:29 < bbraun> But I can tell you what you typed in is not expected to work.
19:30 < probono> i have built relpath and libstreams before
19:30 < snu> 6.10   Compiling the Kernel
19:30 < snu> 6.10.1   Retrieving Prerequisite Packages
19:30 < snu> 6.10.2   Compiling Prerequisite Packages
19:30 < snu> 6.10.3   Compiling the xnu Package
19:30 < snu> 6.10.4   DarwinBuild
19:30 < snu> sounds like you probalby skipped a step or 2
19:31 < probono> maybe it's because singh didn't have 10.4.9 yet
19:31 < snu> maybe
19:32 < snu> i wonder if osxbook is on safari
19:32 < probono> fyi, 6.10.4 is exactly 9 lines long, in a book with 1641 pages
19:33 < probono> snu: the hardcopy says it's in safari too
19:36 < jgw> probono: much of that stuff has changed significantly after the book was published
19:37 < jgw> blame apple, not singh :)
19:37 < snu> yeah
19:38 < snu> although i thought you had to have kernel headers before you could build cctools
19:38 < snu> since for eva
19:40  * probono needs to google eva

19:54 < jkh> bbraun: well, the readership seems to be slowly going up
19:54 < jkh> bbraun: is this the new #opendarwin?
19:54 < bbraun> jkh: it's passing to torch to a younger generation
19:54 < jkh> a GNU generation?
19:55 < vmlemon> lol
19:55 < probono> hi jkh, welcome
19:55 < probono> great honor to have you here
19:55 < bbraun> jkh: see what I mean?
19:56 < jkh> well, I was mostly drawn here by the ??????? ?????? ????? quote
19:56 < bbraun> It seems jkh has passed into the hallowed halls of the elders and I'm the man keepin' 'em down.
19:56 < jkh> bbraun: you always filled that role though
19:56 < bbraun> I've always tried, that's for sure
19:57 < jkh> bbraun is the deep wellspring of cynicism from which younger, less accomplished cynics occasionally draw their inspiration and supply from
19:57 < bbraun> jkh: I showed them my pre-apple daemonnews article
19:58 < bbraun> just to show what my apple/darwin experience has done to me.
19:58 < jkh> probono: I don't suppose it would be considered an impertinent request that some sort of project goal / manifesto be posted on your site?
19:58 < probono> jkh: see the # topic
19:58 < jkh> The quote from ??????? ?????? ????? is nice
19:58 < jkh> but it's not really a mission statement
19:58 < bbraun> not yet officially announced, dude
19:58 < bbraun> chill for a bit
19:58 < jkh> well yes, but it has a logo
19:58 < jkh> I always thought the logo came after the mission statement. :)
19:59 < semilia|off> jkh: working on a useful enviorment for building a base system here first :P
19:59 < jkh> semilia|off: where your definition of "base system" is?
20:00 < vmlemon> Foundation for building a workable system?
20:00 < semilia|off> well basic os things like a kernel, shell, driver, filesystem etc.
20:00 < semilia|off> and enivorment = foundation for building + testing
20:00 < jkh> so, essentially an opendarwin
20:00 < probono> we were told that that was dead
20:00 < jkh> all the free and open bits hanging together as a stand-alone OS?
20:00 < jkh> opendarwin is dead, indeed
20:00 < jkh> I meant it simply as a point of comparison
20:00 < semilia|off> no not a opendarwin
20:00 < vmlemon> We're not OpenDarwin, we're a few steps better ;)
20:00 < semilia|off> i don'T like zombies
20:01 < semilia|off> something new
20:01 < vmlemon> The UnOpenDarwin 
20:01 < bbraun> like opendarwin, just not dead.
20:01 < jkh> vmlemon: those steps being... ?
20:01 < semilia|off> requires some programming and serious enginering before i can call it somehow
20:01 < jkh> please please, I'm trying to determine technical points of differentiation
20:01 < semilia|off> even call it abse
20:01 < semilia|off> *a base
20:01 < jkh> let's leave the ideological comparison aside for the moment
20:02 < semilia|off> <- pure tech
20:02  * probono imagines our work to be similar to kvv's, but not only for major releases
20:02 < jkh> but is the goal to have this collection of bits stand-alone as an OS in their own right?
20:02 < jkh> or just have it augment MacOSX in some way?
20:02 < vmlemon> One of the goals was to have a working product
20:02 < semilia|off> jkh: standalone update darwin
20:02 < vmlemon> that was as true to what Apple supplied as possible
20:03 < jkh> Hmmm.
20:03 < probono> hence, pure
20:03 < jkh> Well, good luck with that I guess.
20:03 < jkh> Speaking as an insider, however...
20:03 < semilia|off> jkh: i know the trip wires and stuff :)
20:03 < jkh> I can only tell you that this job is going to get harder, not easier, as time goes on
20:03 < vmlemon> It's an uphill thing
20:03 < jkh> we're vectoring away from that direction
20:03 < vmlemon> and will be all the way
20:03 < probono> jkh: kvv does a great job btw, his 8.0.1.iso is close
20:03 < jkh> so you're chasing the bus, and the bus is going at 200MPH
20:03 < probono> if only it wasn't binary incompatible with recent binaries
20:04 < vmlemon> it by 10, and you're there ;)
20:04 < vmlemon> *divide it
20:04 < jkh> yeah, well, his 8.0.1 ISO is also the last of its kind
20:04 < semilia|off> jkh: i know my stuff here if it comes to what i want to do ;)
20:04 < probono> jkh: in what respect?
20:04 < jkh> semilia|off: hey, I work inside the sausage factory, I know _exactly_ what's involved in doing what you want to do
20:05 < bbraun> jkh: well, mostly exactly.  =)
20:05 < semilia|off> jkh: i know :) let me show you curry sausage ala cart ;)
20:05 < jkh> bbraun: yes, modulo any missing information he hasn't told me. :)
20:05 < jkh> So, let me read between the lines a little
20:06 < bbraun> speaking of which...  my SIGLUNCH handler has high latency today.
20:06 < jkh> the goal of puredarwin is to reverse-engineer and replace enough of the missing bits that MacOSX/x86 can be made to run on commodity PC hardware
20:06 < jkh> I can totally see where semilia|off is going here. :)
20:07 < probono> it's not a mac os related project at all
20:07 < jkh> probono: you say that NOW, just wait to see who shows up to your picnic
20:07 < vmlemon> AFAIK, the idea is to use the components as Apple shipped them (e.g. binary bits and all)
20:07 < jkh> I can't officially wish you luck with the MacOSX on Dell project here
20:07 < semilia|off> i just want a working and open darwin from latest available pool of source
20:07 < jkh> but I will watch it with interest
20:07 < bbraun> vmlemon: +running darwin on non-osx hardware
20:08 < semilia|off> jkh: we not here to get osx on a dell we want a standalone darwin
20:08 < jkh> semilia|off: *wink*
20:08 < probono> jkh: you don't seem to get it
20:08 < vmlemon> It isn't intended to be another "let's break Mac OS X in a dozen ways to work on a Dell", and will not be, either
20:08 < bbraun> heh.  I suspect jkh gets it more than most of the rest of the channel
20:09 < jkh> hey, I totally understand the need for a cover story
20:09 < probono> in general, probably
20:09 < semilia|off> jkh: we go and build opensource darwin as it was build ages before what is wrong about it?
20:09 < vmlemon> OSx86 and InsanelyMac already do the Dell-ification, which is what PureDarwin is not and will not be about ;)
20:10  * jkh grins
20:11 < jkh> semilia|off: the problem, of course, is all the missing pieces
20:12 < jkh> semilia|off: and once you replace the missing pieces, guess what?  All your users will say: WOOT!  OSx86!
20:12 < semilia|off> jkh: i have no problem with writing and fill gaps
20:12 < semilia|off> but well and i don't liek to aid piracy
20:12 < jkh> at the very least, the OSx86 will come and freely partake of the pieces you fill in since they haven't managed it very well yet
20:12 < jkh> so, ultimately, the two projects will be seen as one and the same
20:13 < probono> by whom?
20:13 < jkh> and since OSx86 is what 99.9% of the "Darwin hackers" actually WANT...
20:13 < vmlemon> Some of us are interested in making what could be described as an alternative to other open and platforms
20:13 < semilia|off> jkh: well than that needs to be prevented in some way
20:13 < jkh> probono: by anyone who's following the trail of obvious majority interest
20:13 < snu> vmlemon: to what end? to be different just because you can?
20:14 < jkh> let me make an analogy if it will help
20:14 < vmlemon> *open and closed platforms
20:14 < jkh> you go to a relatively seedy part of town and you set up a huge pot of chicken gumbo with a sign saying "free soup" in front of it
20:14 < snu> jkh: proof by analogy is fraud.
20:14 < jkh> with the stated goal of appealing to gourmets who happen to live in that part of town
20:15 < jkh> you should not be surprised if most of the people who show up are the homeless instead
20:15 < jkh> some of whom may have taste, but filling hunger being the priority rather than appreciating your tasty soup
20:15 < probono> given your impressive history, this view of the world comes a bit surprising to me
20:15 < jkh> I'm a pragmatist
20:15 < jkh> you know who most of FreeBSD's users were and are today?
20:16 < jkh> not idealists
20:16 < jkh> ISPs
20:16 < jkh> businessmen looking for a free lunch. :)
20:16 < semilia|off> that is opensource
20:16 < jkh> and I am and was OK with that
20:16 < semilia|off> software communism of some kind
20:16 < jkh> I'm just attempting to share that hard-won point of view with you guys
20:17 < jkh> if you are successful, you will be seen as a MacOSX-on-generic project
20:17 < jkh> period.
20:17 < jkh> (sorry)
20:17 < probono> jkh: how can we prevent this?
20:17 < jkh> and you will be seen that way because people WANT to see things that way
20:17 < snu> probono: through failure.
20:17 < jkh> snu's point is brutal but correct
20:18 < semilia|off> well than apple distributes it'S own osx on generivc with darwin x-)
20:18 < probono> (we're pragmatists too. we don't want apple to take away our toys.)
20:18 < snu> heh
20:18 < semilia|off> jkh: in the end all world is politic :/
20:19 < bbraun> just to connect the final dots...  If apple sees such a project do that, they will not make the bits available anymore for anyone else.
20:19 < probono> jkh: i heard apple is hiring for a new open source position
20:19 < jkh> bbraun: well, I'm not sure I'd go that far.  Let's just say they'll continue to make things harder for people going the "stand-alone darwin" route
20:19 < bbraun> so, assuming  you're successful, you'll not only bring about your own eventual failure, but also ruin it for everyone else.
20:19 < bbraun> how do I help?
20:19 < jkh> bbraun: *thwap*
20:19 < snu> probono: no, apple is hiring to fill their existing open source position.
20:20 < jkh> bbraun has a real talent for peeing in the cheeries
20:20 < jkh> erm, cheerios
20:20 < bbraun> jkh: ruining my optimism again?  sheesh
20:20 < snu> jkh: at least it gives them some flavour
20:20 < jkh> heh
20:20 < jkh> OK, let's back up
20:20 < jkh> you guys want to know the two poles of gravitational attraction in Darwin-land?
20:20 < jkh> I'll spell it out
20:20 < jkh> 1.  OSx86
20:20 < snu> 1. hardcore pornography
20:20 < jkh> 2. MacOSX hacking
20:21 < jkh> (where the latter is defined as "doing cool add-ons/mods to MacOSX"
20:21 < jkh> snu: I wasn't referring to YOUR attractions
20:21 < snu> ;)
20:21 < jkh> so pretty much any effort will eventually turn in one of those two directions because that's where the pull of gravity is
20:21 < bbraun> jkh: also professionals developing 3rd party tools using the source as docs, since apple doesn't do docs.
20:21 < snu> bbraun: that's kind of a subclass of "Mac OS X hacking" though
20:22 < jkh> bbraun: yeah, there's the whole doc thing, but if you really wanted to add value there, you'd have to... write docs... or something.  Amit Singh already exists.
20:22 < jkh> probono: do you understand what I"m trying to explain here?
20:22 < semilia|off> jkh: fromt his point of view you can turn anything to worse
20:22 < probono> jkh: don't make knives because they can be used to hurt people
20:22 < bbraun> jkh: I've already tried, man.
20:22 < jkh> I'm not trying to "look on the dark side" here (that's bbraun's job), I'm just telling you the reality of what turns people on
20:23 < jkh> no, I don't buy the whole guns kill people argument either
20:23 < jkh> husbands who come home early do
20:23 < probono> :)
20:23 < jkh> however, that's not the point I'm trying to argue at all
20:23 < jkh> I'm simply saying that anyone hacking on Darwin eventually winds up in one of those two buckets
20:23 < jkh> because the gravitational pull eventually pulls them there
20:23 < probono> anyone.
20:23 < jkh> over time, anyone, yes
20:24 < jkh> I mean, you can be insaaaane like proclus
20:24 < bbraun> jkh: I've already been through it.  It seems to be something one has to learn for themselves.
20:24 < jkh> but he's doing it as a political statement
20:24 < jkh> so he's kind of in a category of one
20:24 < semilia|off> jkh: better argument, i own 2 guys but i am not killing people, why? caus ei think it is wrong. i will build a new opendarwin, i can use it to piracy, i don't do, why? cause it is wrong.
20:24 < semilia|off> guys = guns
20:24 < jkh> semilia|off: that was an unfortunate typo
20:25 < probono> if proclus did less protesting and more work he might get somewhere :)
20:25 < semilia|off> jkh: one hand typing
20:25 < jkh> OK, to use your guns analogy here
20:25 < jkh> since I also own a small arsenal
20:25 < jkh> in THIS world, however, you leave your guns out in the living room where anyone can find them
20:25 < jkh> also, you leave the front door unlocked
20:26 < jkh> then you invite a pre-school class over
20:26 -!- gh1 [n=eric@opendarwin/developer/gh1] has joined #puredarwin
20:26 < jkh> the analogy does not work. :)
20:26 < semilia|off> lol
20:26  * gh1 gets popcorn
20:26 -!- semilia|off is now known as semilia
20:27 < jkh> open source projects are rarely directed solely by their leadership
20:27 < jkh> over time, your users will push the project in whatever areas they want to contribute
20:27 < jkh> then we're back to the "two poles of gravity" I talked about
20:27 < jkh> you may own the guns, but you do not get to say how they're used. :)
20:27 < semilia> well there is mplayer it can play movies people most of the time have pirated, is it bad cause of this? you can fairly abuse anything in either way
20:28 < jkh> ah, that's an excellent example
20:28 < probono> GCC
20:28 < probono> people could write cracks with it!
20:28 < jkh> mplayer is getting a lot of attention these days
20:28 < jkh> more than it got before
20:28 < jkh> why?
20:28 < jkh> AppleTV
20:28 < vmlemon> Then, there's the famous VLC
20:28 < jkh> the AppleTV hackers want to use it as part of their desire to open up that platform to ALL kinds of video media
20:29 < jkh> and I'm not even saying they're wrong to do so
20:29 < jkh> but it's definitely not what the original mplayer hackers saw in the future - they figured they'd be a little desktop video player
20:29 < jkh> not a bunch of codecs
20:29 < jkh> is this wrong or illegal?  No
20:29 < jkh> voids your warrantee maybe, but who cares
20:30  * probono stays away from the temptation to cite from http://www.apple.com/opensource/
20:30 < jkh> however, it's a good example of how demand morphys products
20:30 < jkh> erm, projects even
20:30 < jkh> and morphs even
20:30 < jkh> can't type with cat on keyboard
20:30 < jkh> Like I said, I'm not making the "your making guns" argument
20:30 < jkh> semilia did
20:30 < semilia> hmm well you are afraid our work could turn against apple?
20:30 < jkh> naw, not raelly
20:30 < jkh> (damn cat)
20:31 < jkh> I'm just saying....
20:31 < semilia> so what is the cat ah point in that :)
20:31 < jkh> this is where you guys are headed, so at least head there with your eyes open
20:31 < semilia> i not want to head there
20:31 < jkh> hey, I don't want to die either
20:31 < jkh> but I'm headed there, one way or another. :)
20:31 < probono> jkh: how would a successful open source project built around darwin have to look like in your opinion?
20:31 < bbraun> and by doing your work, you're ruining it for everyone.  Just remember that.
20:32 < jkh> probono: linux or *BSD
20:32 < probono>  built around darwin?
20:32 < jkh> no, I wouldn't start with darwin
20:32 < semilia> ah so that is the deal around here not to touch darwin cause there are evil folks out there?
20:32 < bbraun> success and darwin have traditionally been mutually exclusive, given roughly 8 yrs of experience on the subject
20:33 < jkh> I wouldn't start with Darwin for the same reason I wouldn't start with AIX or HP/UX or SCO
20:33 < jkh> I wouldn't want to be an open source project trying to track a commercial OS
20:33 < probono> sco lol :)
20:33 < semilia> i would not touch SCO cause it is SCO lol
20:33 < jkh> let me try a slightly different approach
20:33 < jkh> let's assume for the moment that you're all bright, talented hackers
20:34 < jkh> and also have enough free time to make any kind of project worthwhile
20:34 -!- benoitc [n=benoitc@dyn-91-163-25-59.ppp.tiscali.fr] has joined #puredarwin
20:34 < jkh> why go over old ground?  That would be like launching an expedition to discover... Akron, Ohio
20:34 < jkh> why not invent something new and interesting?
20:34 < semilia> i already written a os so ..
20:34 < jkh> it can always run on Mac hardware, among other possible platforms
20:35 < jkh> and frankly, with Darwin you're starting with something that's over 10 years old
20:35 < semilia> well i like old timer
20:35 < jkh> so innovation is not likely to occur for you when you spend most of your time trying to figure out what other people did and why
20:35 < probono> ist this a hint that apple might switch kernels soon?
20:35 < probono> remember that person that recently left, anyone
20:35 < bbraun> omg, jkh confirms osx is switching to l4.
20:35 < jkh> let's just say it's an option that's always open
20:35 < bbraun> you heard it here first!
20:35 < jkh> heh
20:35 < jkh> I'm not hinting at anything
20:36 < jkh> but I wouldn't say "No, impossible!" either
20:36 < jkh> clearly, of course, the landscape is changing
20:36 < semilia> apple switch kernel to... what lol break all compatible stuff up?
20:36 < jkh> OS on phone, OS on laptops, OS on big machines
20:36 < jkh> do the math for yourselves
20:36 < bbraun> 3
20:36  * jkh gives bbraun a cookie
20:36 < probono> oh, glad you touch this poing
20:36 < probono> point
20:37 < probono> will there be darwin for arm?
20:37 < semilia> i want osx on my calculator
20:37 < probono> pure darwin i mean
20:37 < jkh> heh heh
20:37 < jkh> what do you guys think?
20:37 < probono> jkh: i'll explain you why i ask
20:37 < semilia> apple switchs again to .. arm x-)
20:37 < vmlemon> If you can dream it, you can do it
20:37 < probono> there are lots of embedded NAS devices and routers
20:37 < bbraun> jkh: can you comment on unreleased future products?
20:38 < probono> which happen to run on mips/mipsel
20:38 < jkh> bbraun: sure, just so long as I get to totally make 'em up
20:38 < jkh> bbraun: sparclar!  The dream lives on!
20:38 < bbraun> can you confirm that 10.5 is a repackaged redhat?
20:38 < bbraun> ah, sparclar

22:48 < semilia> lol
22:48 < bbraun> presumably you don't mean me
22:48 < jgw> who does this newb mean? ;)
22:48 < probono> jgw: like, next times?
22:48 < snu> bbraun: are you the oldest darwin person?
22:48 < jgw> probono: eh?
22:48 < probono> NeXT even ;)
22:49 < snu> uh
22:49 < snu> darwin postdates NeXT
22:49 < jgw> probono: i have a NeXTStation yeah
22:49 < snu> there was no overlap
22:49 < jgw> i dont even think it boots anymore
22:49 < probono> snu: you mean after NeXT bought apple, right
22:49 < jgw> i was unable to afford a NeXT when they came out
22:49 < bbraun> snu: oldest in what sense?
22:49 < snu> longest involvement with darwin
22:49 < vmlemon> I have a NeXTStep 3.3 VM, but the mouse exhibits a strange bouncing behaviour and does random things
22:49 < jgw> but i used a NeXT box a lot in the 90s when they were only mildly obsolete
22:50 < snu> obviously you're not the oldest person, that's jkh
22:50 < vmlemon> Plus, it's in wonderful monochrome
22:50 < bbraun> snu: there were folks involved before me.  But as far as continuously involved?  kvv and I are probably the longest continually involved with darwin, not counting apple employees working on osx.
22:50 < snu> i thought your involvement predated kvv's
22:51 < vmlemon> Anyone remember Rhapsody?
22:51 < jgw> vmlemon: probably everyone here :D
22:51 < bbraun> eh, I don't really remember.  seemed to be close, within a few months maybe.
22:51 < vmlemon> I noticed something interesting about using NeXTStep 3.3 binaries on Darwin
22:52 < jgw> vmlemon: seg faults? heh
22:52 < bbraun> should mostly work.
22:52 < vmlemon> It crashes the kernel and says that some instructions are being called that are deprecated or something like that
22:52 < bbraun> heh.  nice.
22:53 < bbraun> I wonder if some 10.0 things cause that too
22:53 < bbraun> I remember running some nextstep binaries on darwin in the early days.
22:53 < vmlemon> Just taking the Capsule image off my USB drive, and converting it, and I'll have another play with running an NS Binary
22:54 < bbraun> although nextstep binaries as an osx DoS is amusing.
22:54 < probono> ok, kernel is being compiled
22:55 < probono> let's see when the next error comes ;)
22:55 < vmlemon> WTF, the Windows box I used the drive on earlier trashed my disk image :/
22:56 < probono> did you say Windows? ;)
22:56 < vmlemon> Going to have to do the FAT format du-jour again
22:56 < bbraun> you should make cocoashell for osx instead of working on darwin.  it'd be sooo much cooler.
22:56 < vmlemon> Can't distribute OS X, though, tut tut ;)
22:57 < vmlemon> That's the Darwin Advantage
22:57 < bbraun> don't need to distribute a whole os to work on cocoashell
22:57 < jgw> cocoashell?
22:57 < vmlemon> Well, true, but it's not as much fun to wrangle with
22:57 < bbraun> objc powershell
22:57 < jgw> ugh
22:57 < jgw> well actually that might be really cool
22:57 < jgw> if you didnt have to garbage collect
22:58 < vmlemon> Mach-O binary support on Linux would be nice
22:59 < probono> garbage collection is in darwin 9
22:59 < jgw> its optional in objc 2.0 but yeah
22:59 < snu> garbage collection is in darwin 8
23:00 < jgw> he means automatic
23:00 < jgw> not semi-automatic ;)
23:00 < vmlemon> Any idea if/when Darwin 9 will ever see the light of day?
23:01 < kvv> sources get posted after the Mac OS X release ships
23:01 < vmlemon> OK
23:02 < vmlemon> Faster NeXTStep, faster 
23:02 < snu> kvv: oooh, is that confirmation? :P
23:02 < jgw> kvv confirms!
23:02 < kvv> that at least some sources will be posted after Leopard ships?  sure
23:02 < kvv> i won't commit to how long after, or which sources though
23:02 < bbraun> vmlemon: For my initial attempt at macho execution under fbsd: http://www.synack.net/~bbraun/WebSVN/filedetails.php?repname=bbraun&path=%2Fmisc%2Fmach-o.c&rev=0&sc=0
23:03 < vmlemon> I think I saw something similar for NetBSD a while ago
23:03 < snu> kvv: SYNCHRONOUS RELEASE, QUARTZ!
23:03 < snu> woot
23:03 < snu> you heard it here first, /.
23:03 < bbraun> yes, theirs was much more complete
23:03 < vmlemon> I wonder why NS refuses to format VMware hard drive partitions 
23:04 < vmlemon> Going to have to boot the Windows VM (eew) just to format it
23:08 < probono> Darwin Kernel Version 8.9.1: Sat Apr 21 00:02:05 CEST 2007; root:xnu-792.18.15/BUILD/obj/RELEASE_I386
23:08 < probono> :)
23:08 < vmlemon> Yay
23:09 < vmlemon> Hmm, at least here Darwin boots faster than NS3.3
23:09 < probono> Yay
23:09 < vmlemon> Now to see if NeXTStep will use the freshly formatted partition
23:09 < probono> was a far quicker and less troublesome experience than the linux kernels i've built
23:09 < semilia> i still wodner why darwin bootloader does not install to vmware disk
23:10 < probono> building time alone... darwin hardly leaves you time for a coffee :)
23:10 < vmlemon> probono: Which technique did you use to compile it?
23:10 < vmlemon> See, another Darwin Advantage ;)
23:10 < probono> a debugged version of singh's instructions
23:10 < semilia> the secret force of xcode x-)
23:10 < vmlemon> Lightning speed kernel compiles
23:11 < probono> ok now, what do i need to build next?
23:11 < semilia> that kernel won't work
23:12 < probono> a kernel alone ain't giving much fun :)
23:12 < vmlemon> Try updating the awfully broken and outdated toolchain ;)
23:13 < vmlemon> Just about to try my NeXTStep 3.3 ls binary on Darwin
23:16 < probono> vmlemon: don't you have a bsd 1.0 binary? ask jkh
23:16 < vmlemon> and it says "** Attempt to execute a Mach 2.5 system call at EIP=14250 EAX=fffffff6(10)" "panic(cpu 0 caller 0xC017B68F): FIXME!"
23:16 < probono> ok, do what it says: FIXIT! ;)
23:16 < vmlemon> Going to try the other way, and test a Darwin binary on NS3.3
23:17 < kvv> sounds like a good waste of time =)
23:17 < vmlemon> probono: I guess something special happens with a BSD 1.0 binary?
23:17 < probono> kvv: vmlemons efforts or my kernel compiling?
23:18 < bbraun> on darwin/vax?
23:18 < bbraun> or darwin/pdp11?
23:18 < kvv> running random binaries on other systems that have no hope of doing anything useful
23:18 < vmlemon> Hmm, the Apple logo'd spinner makes it look as if it's taking longer to boot than it really does
23:18  * semilia suggest doing something useful
23:18 < probono> kvv: what comes after building the kernel?
23:19 < vmlemon> Makes my slow booting Gentoo Linux install look faster at booting ;)
23:19 < kvv> probono: endless suffering? =)  seriously, i dunno, what are you trying to do?
23:19 < kvv> probono: you could install the kernel on 10.4.9 and see if it still boots
23:19 < kvv> that's what I'd do
23:19 < kvv> then I'd probably grab a beer and celebrate
23:19 < probono> run a shell from self-built components is my first target
23:19 < vmlemon> Don't forget to share the kernel ;)
23:19 < probono> kvv: ah
23:19 < probono> good plan :)
23:20 < vmlemon> The first precompiled kernel for distribution
23:20 < jgw> call richard stallman and tell him you have a working kernel for hurd
23:20 < vmlemon> Milestone 1 complete ;)
23:20 < probono> vmlemon: not so quick
23:20 < kvv> probono: if it does still boot, you could try compiling some of the other low-level components... cctools_ofiles, cctools, dyld, Libc, etc.
23:20 < vmlemon> Just switch HURD for XNU and give him it back ;)
23:21 < vmlemon> It's still Mach-esque enough
23:21 < probono> jgw: wasted effort as hurd will come out next year anyway
23:21 < jgw> XNURD!
23:21 < vmlemon> Xurd?
23:21 < probono> where did i read about xnu/debian?
23:21 < vmlemon> Hmm, looks a little bit too much like "turd" ;)
23:21 < probono> on proclus' site?
23:22 < kvv> probono: are you building using DarwinBuild?
23:22 < vmlemon> OK, Super Happy Fun Darwin binary on NS3.3 time ;)
23:22 < semilia> i don't liek to disturbe but a compiled xnu source is worthless towards a darwin
23:22 < probono> no, a debugged version of singh's bare metal instructions
23:23 < vmlemon> lol, "./ksh: Not enough memory"
23:23 < vmlemon> DAMN, it's not dramatic enough
23:23 < semilia> don't glorify singh all the time lol
23:23 < vmlemon> I want to see obsolete kernels explode and dump core

21:27 < vmlemon> Ping
21:30 < bbraun> pong
21:32 < vmlemon> Any ideas about shipping audio drivers for the VMware platform? Do we create our own? Or use Maxxuss's and put them into a seperate repository?
21:33 < bbraun> Can you actually use audio drivers in darwin?  There's no coreaudio, so I'm not sure how you'd actually play sound, should a driver be available.
21:35 < vmlemon> I found that they were installable, but I'd need to investigate if it's possible to produce sound at all
21:36 < probono> vmlemon: not sure how the audio system in fink works
21:37 < bbraun> fink doesn't have it's own audio system.  esd and other apps are ported to use coreaudio on Mac OS X.
21:38 < probono> ok, but that's step 273.564 anyway ;)
21:38 < vmlemon> I'd assume that a sound system would need to be built or something like ALSA/OSS would need to be ported?
21:38 < semilia|off> "Or use Maxxuss's and put them into a seperate repository?" <- in case you not udnerstood guideline, we are NOT osx86 or related...

22:09 < semilia|off> god, worst chipset combined
22:09 < semilia|off> via + amd .. dream dou :P
22:09 < probono> semilia|off: SiS...
22:09 < semilia|off> ok SiS and Via same stage :P
22:10 < vmlemon> Kubuntu is the only Linux distro I've confirmed IrDA to work in. I would prefer to use Gentoo, but it doesn't work with the IrDA chipset, even though it's supported
22:13 < vmlemon> As for Windows, no way do I want to use that
22:13 < probono> bbraun: http://rafb.net/p/uXe4c123.txt
22:14 < bbraun> probono: thanks.
22:14 < vmlemon> 3rd Time Unlucky for burning the ISO :(
22:14 < bbraun> cool.  it does have the subdoc.  you built bootstrap_cmds-49 from the plist for 8P2137.  =)
22:15 < probono> i guess it also tells you my shoe size. :)
22:15 < vmlemon> 4th time lucky, finally
22:15 < bbraun> heh.  nah, there is a lot more that could go in, like what packages+versions were used to build it, etc.
22:16 < bbraun> would be nice for trying to reproduce build results
22:16 < vmlemon> xar is going to be used for distributing PureDarwin packages?
22:16 < probono> that's too early to assume
22:16 < probono> depends on what the installer team picks ;)
22:17 < vmlemon> Where is the Installer Team?
22:17 < probono> lol
22:17 < vmlemon> Or isn't there one? (Yet)
22:17 < vmlemon> Or do we just do everything, all of the time?
22:17 < bbraun> xar isn't really a packager anyway, it's just an archiver that allows for arbitrary metadata to be stuck in.  darwinbuild just jams in it's plist.  I wouldn't go so far as to call that a 'package'
22:18  * probono wonders if bbraun works on embedding dependency info
22:18 < bbraun> at least in the svn version of xar, it does parse macho files and scripts and records dependen libraries and interpreter
22:18 < vmlemon> Will xar support archiving Linux FIFO, block, and char node files?
22:19 < bbraun> I believe it supports block/char node files.  It will record a fifo as having existed, but it really doesn't make much sense to extract it...
22:19 < vmlemon> I've tested archiving them, and it seems to get stuck, and doesn't produce any output
22:19 < bbraun> huh, lemme test.
22:19 < vmlemon> even when mixed with a directory containing other files
22:21 < bbraun> char and block devices seem to work for me.
22:21 < bbraun> hmm.  well, archival works.  extraction just produces a regular file...
22:21 < bbraun> that be a bug
22:21 < vmlemon> Could it be to do with using the latest stable version, and not the development version?
22:23 < bbraun> maybe.  I'm testing with the latest from subversion
22:23 < bbraun> it's been over a year since a release was made, so I don't recall all the changes.  =)
22:24 < probono> i used the latest from svn, too
22:25 < bbraun> I've filed a bug on the device node issue.
22:26 < vmlemon> Thanks
22:26 < vmlemon> I'm tempted to see if it'll compile on BeOS ;)
22:27 < bbraun> heh.  that'll be interesting.  I haven't been able to get my beos 4.5 working in vmware
22:28 < vmlemon> Works fine for me, but there's graphics are monochrome, and the mouse sometimes exhibits random behaviour (similar to NeXTStep and Rhapsody)
22:28 < vmlemon> *the graphics
22:28 < vmlemon> I tried it on an old Pentium 2, and it worked fully, albeit without networking
22:30 < vmlemon> BeOS 5, here
22:30 < bbraun> ah, yeah, I heard that works better under vmware
22:31 -!- Netsplit sterling.freenode.net <-> irc.freenode.net quits: probono
22:31 -!- Netsplit over, joins: probono
22:33 < vmlemon> It's booted fine on my laptop, so far
22:34 < vmlemon> The trackpad and other devices are detected fine, but I'm not sure if the error about the PCMCIA bus is that important or not
22:35 < bbraun> I've never heard of PCMCIA working correctly in darwin/x86
22:35 < bbraun> I haven't looked into it though
22:36 < vmlemon> It cries if I unplug the USB keyboard, and it's got stuck twice at "The following devices are available for instalation:"
22:36 < vmlemon> I'm sure it's not supposed to just say "Welcome to the installation of", either
22:37 < vmlemon> The console font looks nice on the display it's using, though
22:38 < vmlemon> The white text contrast is too sharp and bright for me, for some reason, even though the Linux console isn't like that at all on it
22:39 < vmlemon> It's like looking at a camera flash or a lightbulb, compared to my CRT on the desktop
22:39 < probono> please
22:40 < vmlemon> I'll get used to it, though
22:43 < probono> vmlemon: do you know sql?
22:43 < vmlemon> Some SQL, anyway
22:43 < probono> i need a working SORT statement for darwin's version numbers
22:43 < probono> a "natural sort"
22:44 < probono> ORDER BY even
22:44 < vmlemon> The SELECT * FROM database stuff, but not sure about SORTs, to be honest
22:44 < probono> ok
22:45 < vmlemon> Hmm, it doesn't like to do anything with hard drive partitions, even if I use platform=X86PC at boot
22:45 < probono> might be the via ata
22:46 < vmlemon> Most probably
22:46 < vmlemon> I guess Apple only intended for it to be used on Intel hardware, and not AMD hardware, for some reason
22:46 < probono> have a look at http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/apsl/AppleVIAATA-6.tar.gz
22:47 < vmlemon> Getting it onto a bootable volume will be fun
22:48 < vmlemon> Much less onto an ISO, when Darwin doesn't even boot ;)
22:50 < bbraun> the only platform I've had reliable darwin/x86 experience with is an intel 440BX mobo, and make sure it has PIIX4 ide controllers.  And an Intel ethernet controller.
22:50 < vmlemon> That's tricky 
22:51 < bbraun> I ran darwin/x86 on an ibm thinkpad for a while back in the day.
23:44 < vmlemon> Bye for now

11:40 < vmlemon> When I try and boot from it using the DVD+RW burner (1st optical drive), the welcome message is "Welcome to the installation of", hard disks are not detected at all, and I am given no option to drop into a shell
11:40 < vmlemon> Yet, if I use the DVD-ROM drive (2nd optical drive), the correct welcome message is displayed, and the disks are detected fine
11:47 < vmlemon> I still haven't got it to function on the AMD box, yet
11:51 < probono> yes, it has to do with the master/slave jumpering
11:51 < probono> i experienced the same
11:52 < vmlemon> Modifier keys, and the 3 Lock keys don't function when booted, either
11:53 < vmlemon> Both of my NICs are detected correctly, but I don't know if they will function, either
11:53 < vmlemon> I'm not willing to install it on this box, either, to find out
11:58 < probono> you can boot in single user mode and ping from there if you want
11:59 < vmlemon> I'd had to start it in platform=X86PC mode, to get it to boot without choking on the ACPI stuff

18:22 < vmlemon> Hi
18:23 < probono> hi
19:15 < probono> vmlemon: can you find out what the status of OpenAudio is?
19:15 < probono> http://web.archive.org/web/20050305235221/www.opendarwin.org/projects/OpenAudio/
19:15 < vmlemon> Hmm, "Please note that OpenAudio is written in kernel-space, and could – theoretically – cause your computer to self-destruct or – more likely – cause kernel panics."
19:16 < probono> http://www.daimi.au.dk/~danchr/blog/who might be the guy
19:16 < vmlemon> I guess self-distruction is the number one feature? ;)
19:16 < probono> vmlemon: that's only a general disclaimer saying it's a kernel module
19:16 < vmlemon> Well, true
19:17 < vmlemon> Is OpenDarwin CVS still open?
19:21 < vmlemon> It appears not to be
19:24 < vmlemon> It looks dead and lost, according to Google :(
19:26 < probono> also, what's the status of http://www.xpkg.org/
19:26 < vmlemon> The site itself is running
19:27 < vmlemon> and the software is still obtainable
19:27 < vmlemon> As for OpenDarwin CVS, it appears to be dead and burried, so getting anything later than xpkg-0.1.3a.tar.bz2 is going to be tricky
19:30 < probono> we'll have to ask bbraun on these two, let's remember that
19:30 < vmlemon> OK
19:30 < vmlemon> If we're lucky, he might have a copy of the tree
19:31 < vmlemon> I downloaded a copy of the latest, and the example packages
19:38 < probono> if you're really curious you could try building them
19:38 < vmlemon> I might try that, and have a play to see how they work, if they build
19:52 < vmlemon> Do we have any ideas about the non-Apple distributed components going into PureDarwin, yet?
19:52 < probono> not really
19:53 < probono> but we don't want to re-invent fink :)
19:53 < vmlemon> I'm trying to build the "model system", to get an idea as to what may be present
19:53  * semilia|off thinks it is funny as caveman discuss on how to settle the mars ...
19:54 < vmlemon> I'm assuming that we'd ship xar as one of the added components
19:56 < vmlemon> Anyone with the latest kernel know if it would be a drop-in replacement for the 8.0.1 one after installation?
19:57 < vmlemon> (That is the built kernel itself0
19:57 < vmlemon> )
19:59 < vmlemon> semilia|off: Well, PureDarwin is more important than thinking of going to Mars ;)
19:59 < vmlemon> It's been done too, except without people in the craft going there

20:06  * semilia|off sighs

20:07 < vmlemon> and an AMD laptop (not much use until AMD and VIA chipset support improves)
20:08 < semilia|off> i meant more like... we not even have a base we not even have anythign working how is about thinkign about useful things now?
20:09 < vmlemon> One of us has just managed to get the latest kernel to compile (using a Mac OS X box, I believe), but whether it runs on what we have now, as supplied by Apple, no one knows
20:09 -!- probono [n=user@p549DB3AC.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] has joined #puredarwin

20:12 < semilia|off> no as available from opensource.apple.com
20:12 < vmlemon> OK
20:18 < vmlemon> probono: Can xnu-792.18.15 (Darwin 8.9/Mac OS X 10.4.9) be compiled and installed cleanly without problems on stock 8.0.1? Or do I have to got to any particular lengths to get it to install?
20:19  * semilia|off crys
20:20 < probono> vmlemon: i didn't try it on 8.0.1
20:20 < probono> but it wouldn't work there
20:20 < vmlemon> OK
20:24 < vmlemon> I take it that it would require access to an Intel-based Mac OS X box to compile, then?

22:35 < probono> it's so silent today in #opendarwin
22:36 < vmlemon> You mean, they've stopped poking at PureDarwin and talking about random stuff, for the time being?
22:36 < probono> they don't talk at all
22:36 < vmlemon> Aah
22:37 < vmlemon> Darwin seems to boot fairly fast, and it shuts down fast, too
22:40 < vmlemon> probono: It was them that were digging at the grand project, wasn't it?
22:41 < probono> they're very helpful in general, just a bit sceptic
22:41 < vmlemon> I guess they start off like that, for a while, before settling down and seeing the bigger picture
22:51 < vmlemon> I wonder why Darwin doesn't ship wget by default, when at least to me, it seems more likely that they would have, since I always look for it before curl
23:02 < vmlemon> Yay, xar ./configures, makes and install perfectly without glitches
23:02 < vmlemon> xpkg ./configures properly, but I can't compile it

15:56 < vmlemon> Hi
15:57 < bbraun> vmlemon: I believe the current svn version of xar addresses the device node and fifo archival problems you saw on linux.
15:57 < bbraun> I made some changes this weekend that should fix those
15:58 < vmlemon> Thanks
15:59 < vmlemon> Do we know if it's possible to upgrade bison to 2.4.5 (I think), since xpkg doesn't compile with the 1.x version included with Darwin?
16:00 < vmlemon> And it hasn't been upgraded to a 2.x version in any of Apple's Darwin epositories
16:00 < vmlemon> *repositories
16:02 < bbraun> years ago, I attempted to upgrade bison (~3yrs ago?) in Mac OS X.  This caused several other darwin projects to stop building.  I'm not sure if all of those problems have been addressed or not.
16:03 < bbraun> So, I'd say use the current version first, until you're reasonably sure all current darwin sources build as is, then try the bison upgrade and see if it causes any problems.
16:03 < vmlemon> The same old version is still in all versions up to and including 8.9
16:03 < bbraun> but, I'm not sure if upgrading darwin components fits with the whole 'pure' model.
16:09 < vmlemon> An upgraded toolchain would be nice, for compiling certain things, but Apple's packaging and management of them deviate from the official GNU versions
16:10 < vmlemon> But, it wouldn't really be in keeping with the 'pure' thing
16:10 < bbraun> that'd be a call for the project management to make.  =)
16:11 < vmlemon> Some of the components are really old, and in the case of some, broken, which makes it hell to try and install things like Fink from source
16:14 < bbraun> it's a minefield.  You don't know if the old versions are there for a reason (like bison, existing projects don't build with the newer version) or if apple as just lazy and didn't get around to upgrading.
16:16 < vmlemon> You can, of course install your own GCC, but since it's not "Apple GCC" as such, it doesn't integrate, has critical version information missing and generally doesn't work
16:17 < vmlemon> Upgrading certain other things breaks the system beyond reasonable repair, too
16:17 < bbraun> last I checked, darwin8 had 3 different GCC's and you needed to use the right one for the right source.
16:18 < vmlemon> Even the 4.x.x one is Just Too Old
16:18 < bbraun> This may have been ppc only, I don't know since no one outside apple has built the Intel sources into a coherent distribution.
16:20 < vmlemon> To make things even better (not), some of the major changes that Apple made to some components weren't reincorporated into the components they came from, thanks to maintainers of the respective parts
16:21 < bbraun> in any case, not getting bogged down in details, things may or may not be the way they are for a reason.  I would not recommend making any changes until you have a whole distro built and are able to repeat your results.  Then you can look into changes, but I wouldn't make them lightly.
16:22 < vmlemon> You can't really go back, one you've changed something, and then you usually end up forgetting what you last did, and what caused it to break 
16:23 < bbraun> preaching to the choir man.  That what I did for 4 years, and I'm the one that did many of those changes.
16:24 < vmlemon> "Install Now, Log Later" isn't really the best idea, that said
16:24 < vmlemon> Of course, not knowing why things are the way they are only adds to the problems
16:32 < jgw> working for apple would be a dream come true...
16:32 < jgw> for a masochist.
16:46 < vmlemon> Yay, archiving Linux FIFOs
16:46 < vmlemon> works
16:47 < vmlemon> As does extracting them
16:48 < vmlemon> (using the latest SVN)
16:50 < jgw> vmlemon: have you guys made any progress on a bootable darwin 10.4.9 kernel? :)
16:50 < jgw> 8.whatever.whatever
16:51 < vmlemon> I believe a kernel was compiled, but not on stock Darwin itself
16:53 < probono> yes, i've only compiled the stock 10.4.9 xnu so far
16:53 < probono> but since darwinbuild is working here, i can go on to the next parts to set up a minimal booting system hopefully
16:54 < probono> unfortunately, i found no docs on which parts are needed for a minimalistic booting system
16:56 < bbraun> start with the bootloader + kernel.  If the kernel boots, but panics saying it can't find init, then you know the kernel and bootloader work, and it'll tell you what it needs next.  init, a way to load it (hd device driver), and the things init links against.
16:56 < vmlemon> xnu, bash, perl are usually some of the required things
16:57 < probono> can i prevent the kernel from simply silently rebooting?
16:57 < bbraun> I'd need to understand what it is causing it to silently reboot to answer that.
16:58  * probono remembers windows has a switch for showing  bluescreen vs. rebooting
16:58 < bbraun> at what point is it silently rebooting?  before anything ever gets displayed?
16:58 < probono> yes
16:58 < probono> after the bootloader is done, where it would normally switch resolutions
16:58 < bbraun> does it get the grey boot screen, or does it basically go straight from the bootloader to rebooting?
16:59 < probono> bootloader -> reboot. no "university of california" message
16:59 < probono> maybe it needs a minimal # of kexts
17:00 < bbraun> In that case, I suspect the kernel is not loading or is having a problem while loading a kext cache or something.
17:00 < bbraun> are you giving it a kextcache full of old style kexts, or an empty kextcache?
17:01 < probono> empty kextcache
17:03 < vmlemon> I'd assume you'd at least need AppleI386GenericPlatform, AppleI386PCI and maybe a PATA/SATA controller driver to get it to do anything
17:03 < bbraun> Hmm.  that should be fine.  I'd probably put debugging statements into boot2 to make sure the kernel is actually being loaded.  If it jumps from boot2 to the kernel, then the problem is clearly with the kernel and doesn't involve boot2.  AFAIK, right now there is no evidence everything up to the kernel loading is succeeding.  Perhaps boot2 is failing to load the kernel properly.
17:05 < probono> bbraun: are there any other boot loaders that can load xnu? like grub
17:05 < bbraun> nope
17:06 < bbraun> There are sooo many possibilities the kernel is failing to load, it would be good to start isolating them, starting with the boot loader.
17:07 < bbraun> could be the wrong compiler, could be the macho file format changed and boot2 isn't parsing the new format correctly, could be xnu actually has a bug with no kextcache...  all kinds of things.

18:51 < probono> semilia|off: i could imagine that boot won't get much love from apple any more due to efi
18:52 < bbraun> boot-122 or -132?
18:53 < probono> i tried building 132
18:55 < bbraun> is it just me or is 132 in 10.4.8 x86 sources but not 10.4.9 x86?
18:55 < probono> bbraun: probably because it was unchanged
18:55 < probono> btw, found a little gem in i386/util/ns_box.tiff
18:56 < probono> DR2 splash screen
18:56 < bbraun> unchanged should still be there, just not bolded
18:56 < probono> good point
18:56 < probono> is this the beginning of bios support removal?
18:57 < semilia|off> which bios support?
18:57 < probono> booting the kernel on bios based systems
18:57 < probono> as opposed to efi
19:07 < bbraun> fyi, this is my last darwin8 build environment, with a setup script to get order files, plus the patches I had to make to get things to build (and fix some linking problems and other things) plus gcc_os patches to remove automatic sse2+3 optimizations, etc: http://www.synack.net/~bbraun/darwin8/
19:11 < jgw> wasnt kvv saying bios booting support is gone from the latest sources?
19:11 < probono> thanks bbraun. where are the nosse2 things from?
19:12 < probono> jgw: i remember somehting about less and less bios support, yes
19:12 < jgw> osx86! omg! bbraun pirate!
19:12 < bbraun> from me
19:12 < jgw> probono: didnt kvv bluntly state that bios support isnt there period?
19:12 < bbraun> gcc_os is one of the several gcc compilers used to build darwin.  In OSX, it defaults to using sse2 and sse3 optimizations.  I removed that, and rebuilt stuff
19:15 < probono> so sse2 and 3 isn't just a switch that can be set at compile time?
19:17 < bbraun> you might be able to modify the build flags for every single target in every single project to pass nosse2 flags or something, but that is waaaaay more work
19:17 < probono> i see
19:23 < probono> bbraun: do you know by chance how fink handles those optimizations?
19:25 < bbraun> what optimizations?
19:25 < probono> sse2/3
19:26 < bbraun> the default gcc for osx enables them by default.  This causes no problem for fink since OSX requires sse2/3
19:26 < bbraun> why do you believe fink needs to handle sse2/3 optimizations?
19:30 < probono> if fink binaries were intended to run on non-sse2/3 machines, then they would have to switch off the optimizations
19:31 < bbraun> fink binaries are intended to run on mac os x.  All legitimate mac os x x86 machines have sse2/3.
19:32  * probono wonders how faster fink's wget runs thanks to sse2 ;-)
19:33 < bbraun> why would fink pass -nosse2 to every project it builds if it doesn't have to?
19:33 < bbraun> minimal changes are better.
19:54 < semilia|off> bbraun: any tips reagrdign a good and working test enviorment?
19:55 < bbraun> for building?  a good osx system with the latest xcode and darwinbuild.  darwinbuild will create the necessary chroot with the proper things.
19:56 < vmlemon> And, for the unlucky folks here without Mac OS X? :)
19:56 < bbraun> hosed.
19:56 < semilia|off> bbraun: i meant more like boot testing of kernel
19:57 < semilia|off> let's say hfs+ disks is not the dream of my sleepless nigths
19:57 < bbraun> vmware is good, although I've usually used a second physical machine with 2 root filesystems.  one good, one test.
19:58 < vmlemon> If you like a challenge, there's always Bochs or QEMU
19:59 < bbraun> I've used qemu as well.  I still prefer actual hardware if possible, at least when I run into a problem, so I know whether I'm fighting the emulator/virtualization or not
19:59 < semilia|off> bochs and qemu are tested and do problems
20:00 < vmlemon> Tried the free as in cost Parallels trial for Mac OS X and Linux?
20:00 < semilia|off> the onyl suitebale system f or me so far is vmware
20:00 < semilia|off> (i own it so why use anything elsE?)
20:00 < probono> vmlemon, crashes
20:00 < vmlemon> OK
20:01 < vmlemon> I was tempted to try the newly open-sourced VirtualBox for Linux, but it's pure hell to get it working
20:01 < vmlemon> VMware is probably the best bet for now, though, and real compatible hardware
20:02 < bbraun> I do not have a mac os x x86 machine, so I have not used parallels or vmware fusion.
20:02 < semilia|off> i need a hdd enclosure and use a external disk i can swithc to my vmware running box from mac i think
20:02 < vmlemon> Parallel ATA or Serial ATA?
20:05 < semilia|off> bbraun: does darwin contain support for UFS?
20:05 < probono> it certainly did
20:05 < vmlemon> Only supports Darwin UFS, as far as I know
20:07 < bbraun> yes, it does.  darwin7&8 are kind of in this weird limbo state wrt filesystems.  UFS is not well supported or maintained by apple, so it's kind of a tossup.  Until "recently" (darwin 8?  maybe 7) darwin/x86's boot2 did not have hfs+ support, so it was the only option.
20:07  * semilia|off found all he needs he thinks
20:08 < semilia|off> i digged up a 4 GB pendrive shoudl work...
20:08  * probono loves those
20:08 < vmlemon> Linux supposedly lets you mount them with the -o ufstype=openstep although it's never worked for me
20:09 < semilia|off> pendrive and a dumym partition with bootlaoder in vmware .. what a setup :-o
20:10 < bbraun> I believe (I'm going off really old memory, so beware) the problem with linux's ufs support is problematic because darwin does not do the disklabel thing, and there may also be endian issues (darwin's UFS has traditionally been big endian)
20:10 < vmlemon> Can't you just transplant the hard drive into the other machine, and boot it from that? 
20:10 < vmlemon> Using VMware
20:13 < semilia|off> every time?
20:13 < semilia|off> you crazy?
20:13 < vmlemon> Not every time, of course
20:13 < semilia|off> more than 1 time?
20:14 < vmlemon> Depends on how much switching you think you might do, it's not practical if you need to do it more than once
20:14 < semilia|off> i am building a bsesystem, how many testruns you asume this will take?
20:14 < vmlemon> Not too sure
20:15 < semilia|off> 1*x*10^2
20:15 < bbraun> For the UFS folks out there, this is some documentation I wrote on darwin's ufs layout waaaay back: www.synack.net/~bbraun/disk.txt
20:16 < vmlemon> Aaugh, so many flavours of UFS :/
20:25 < kvv> woot.  got the darwinbuild roots synch'd over to mosf
20:25 < kvv> now to generate some roots for a recent intel build
20:25 < vmlemon> PureDarwin stuff will be mostly hosted on MOSForge?
20:27 < kvv> no i'm talking about DarwinBuild stuff
20:27 < vmlemon> OK
20:46 < probono> vmlemon, you're funny :)
20:46 < vmlemon> Eh?
20:47 < vmlemon> I was being serious
20:57 < vmlemon> Yay, for the most part xar ./configures on BeOS, but I don't have xml2-config installed, so it doesn't continue
20:57 < bbraun> need libxml2
20:58 < vmlemon> Just hope that installs ;)
21:02 < kvv> is pure darwin pure yet? :)
21:02 < vmlemon> Do we have a Darwin purity rating system? ;)
21:03 < kvv> a quiz?
21:03 < bbraun> I'm not pure enough to touch puredarwin, it's that pure.
21:03 < kvv> heh
21:03 < vmlemon> Will libxml2 compile in time to save me from the hideous lack of xar on BeOS?
21:04  * semilia|off reinstalling the testing system the ... 3 time
21:04 < bbraun> I'll be impressed at my own ability to use autoconf conditionals if xar actually runs ok on beos.
21:04 < vmlemon> Going to try it on NS3.3 if it works on BeOS ;)
21:04 < vmlemon> I might try it on Cygwin, too
21:04 < bbraun> semilia|off: not installing, or corrupting it, or?
21:05 < semilia|off> installing as i am trying to get the best setup for testing
21:05 < semilia|off> i am really perfectionistic to my enviorments
21:06 < probono> vmlemon: did you hear of pureBeOS yet? ;-)
21:07 < vmlemon> lol
21:07 < vmlemon> Wait for PureWindows Vista, first 
21:07 < probono> that exists
21:07 < vmlemon> Windows is too impure to get the Pure treatment
21:07 < probono> it's called
21:07 < probono> MS DOS
21:08 < vmlemon> Can tar get any slower?
21:08 < bbraun> no, but xar can!
21:08 < vmlemon> Yay
21:08 < semilia|off> pure vista == empty hdd
21:08 < vmlemon> lol
21:09 < vmlemon> You mean, Windows Vista automatically purifies the HDD if it's not activated?
21:09 < semilia|off> isn't that why they called it (asta la) vista?
21:09 < vmlemon> I always called it Windows Vespa
21:10 < vmlemon> Viruses Infect So Trojans Attack
21:11 < probono> kvv: let's hope darwin is not too pure ;) we were searching for boot-* today on http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.4.9.x86/
21:11 < vmlemon> I know exactly what PureLinux would be, just the kernel
21:12 < kvv> probono: boot is the old bios stuff.  there haven't been any updates in a while.
21:12 < semilia|off> purebrain = min 100
21:13 < vmlemon> bbraun: You mean that slowness is the first sign of optimization?
21:13 < probono> kvv, it even still has a next logo and a dr2 boot screen in the sources :)
21:15 < vmlemon> Which package has the NeXT goodness in it?
21:17 < probono> http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.4.8.x86/boot-132/i386/util/ns_logo.tiff

16:05 < vmlemon> Hi
16:05 -!- Irssi: Join to #puredarwin was synced in 11 secs
16:24 -!- trollinator is now known as jgw
16:30 < vmlemon> Any ideas when PureDarwin will be officially announced?
16:51 < jgw> rofl
16:52 < vmlemon> Well, the topic does say that it isn't officially announced, yet
16:53 < jgw> of course
16:54 < bbraun> probono being the project leader is the only one that can answer that question, and if he wanted to give a date, it'd probably be on the web page already.
17:00 < vmlemon> OK
17:04 < jgw> i would like to see some sort of release within 6 months
17:04 < jgw> (seriously)
17:05 < jgw> even if its just a basic system that boots to a single-user shell
17:05 < vmlemon> I think we all would like to see something that boots
17:08 < jgw> with a current kernel.
17:08 < jgw> and who knows if apple will continue releasing the xnu source
17:08 < bbraun> I would like all kinds of things.  =)
17:08 < jgw> jkh's comments the other day have me questioning the future of an open source xnu, unless i read it wrong
17:08 < bbraun> very few I'm willing to actually work for though.
17:08 < jgw> bbraun: so true.
17:09 < vmlemon> Well, an OS doesn't build itself ;)
17:09 < jgw> its important to note the distinction between "i would like a" and "i would like to see a"
17:09 < jgw> vmlemon: except i'm sane and just use OS X, or Linux
17:09 < bbraun> interpreting the necessarily vague comments of apple employees is an artform, which has led to all kinds of cultish "news" sites around apple.
17:10 < bbraun> and that's how rumors start.  =)
17:10 < jgw> bbraun: indeed
17:10 < jgw> i was going to put that exchange between jkh and co on the web
17:10 < jgw> but have been too lazy
17:11 < jgw> jkh said he was okay with it
17:11 < vmlemon> The rumour mill and hype machine go into overdrive, as soon as anyone does or says anything, pretty much, these days
17:11 < bbraun> But if I were to bet, given jkh's comments and past experience with apple, darwin, and jkh, I would guess that there will be no darwin9 standalone release, and it will likely not be possible to build one.  Whether that means xnu source won't be available, I dunno
17:12 < jgw> well like i said, i pissed and moaned at kvv and co for a xnu source release
17:13 < jgw> and they probably spent many hours on it, due to community pressure
17:13 < jgw> and how many times did i consult xnu source since then? twice.
17:13 < jgw> so maybe not worth it
17:13 < jgw> its always good to have eyes, but i get the feeling there arent many eyes
17:14 < bbraun> a lot of 3rd party developers read xnu source in order to build their products.  Without access to source, it's not clear what will happen to many of those 3rd party products.
17:15 < jgw> eh true, i reckon
17:15 < bbraun> not that apple has really cared much for 3rd party products...
17:18 < jgw> * is depressing
17:18 < jgw> although OS X is least enraging
17:18 < jgw> i prefer less-enraging over less-depressing
17:21 < vmlemon> Of course, if you can get the source, the important part is whether or not it builds
17:22 < jgw> or whether its not 1) worth finicking with to get to build, and 2) building in the first place
17:27 < vmlemon> Anyone got xnu-792.6.22 to build on Darwin?
17:28 < semilia|off> 6 months are a lot of time
17:28 < semilia|off> think you can get something booting
17:28 < semilia|off> :)

17:29 < vmlemon> It's half a year, and we're still in early 2007, so there's probably plenty of time
17:30 < jgw> semilia|off: there's still the obstacle of caring enough
17:35 < semilia|off> jgw: i am worink on this quite busy and i know my current progress :)
18:08 < jgw> semilia|off: i sincerely hope to see tangible progress in the next 6 months
18:10  * bbraun cracks the whip
18:11 < jgw> well i meant "despite my laughing at you guys..."
18:11 < jgw> i sincerely hope you succeed, however laughable and worthless it seems currently
18:12 < jgw> who knows, we said the same shit about linux when linus first started working on it
18:12  * bbraun hands jgw a shovel
18:12 < jgw> all us minix (amiga minix on floppies, at that) users laughing

18:13 < jgw> woot
18:17 < semilia|off> well progress.. i am currently trying to figure which of the build bootloader fites best to my usb thumb any suggestions?
18:18 < semilia|off> minix.. sweet :)
18:20 < probono> there isn't something like usermode-linux for darwin, is there?
18:21 < vmlemon> Xen could work in theory, but it'd need a bit of hacking to work

18:43 < semilia|off> i build already
18:43 < semilia|off> all fine :)

19:01 < vmlemon> I've found something slower than tar :)
19:07 < bbraun> told you
19:08 < vmlemon> It's Alume Systems' unstuff for Linux - The Slowest Decompression Utility On The Planet ;)
19:10 < kvv> woot!  gcc built!
19:10 < vmlemon> Yay
19:12 < semilia|off> kvv: to install the bootloader boot0... it is 512 byte, this will overwrite my partitiontable? :-/
19:13 < bbraun> it is possible to install boot0 without overwriting your partition table, but I'd be careful.  the boot loader does not occupy all 512 bytes.
19:14 < bbraun> the partition table occupies the last little bit, so if you dd that 512 bytes, yes, you will lose your partition table
19:14 < semilia|off> i know
19:14 < semilia|off> problem is the compile is to big well i used dd with count=446 now should force it in :P
19:15 < bbraun> bs=446, count=1
19:15 < semilia|off> i did hope it worked :)
19:16 < bbraun> or bs=1 count=446.  but if you just used 446, you just wrote 512*446 bytes
19:16 < bbraun> since block size defaults to 512, afaik
19:18 < semilia|off> ok b0 worked
19:28 < probono> kvv, i guess that solves the "dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib" i had earlier today?
19:29 < probono> and most likely also the "cc: command not found"
19:31 < kvv> probono: which build are you targetting?
19:34 < bbraun> 4K74
19:35 < probono> 8P2137
19:37 < kvv> bbraun: hah
19:37 < kvv> probono: OK.  are you building on PPC or x86?
19:37 < probono> x86
19:37 < kvv> ok, looks like you'll be my guinea pig =)
19:37 < probono> using the BuildRoot
19:37 < kvv> i have some roots to upload soon.
19:37 < probono> cool :)
19:42 < probono> bbraun: did you ever try PXE?
19:43 < bbraun> try it?  no I never ported boot1/2 to support pxe
19:43 < probono> i just came across some reference to pxe in the boot loader
19:43 < bbraun> there was a rumor that apple had it working internally, but never released working source
19:44 < bbraun> some of that may have slipped out.  I don't know if it actually works or not
19:45 < probono> ko
19:45 < probono> ok
19:45 < probono> :)
19:45 < semilia|off> hmm startupfiletool unwilling to work today
20:43 < kvv> probono: there?
20:44 < semilia|off> kvv, maybe you got an answer, writting boot1 to the partitions first 512 causes the boot to simply hang with _ any ideas on this?
20:45 < probono> kvv: here
20:45 < probono> semilia|off: how do you write the boot1 into the partition?
20:46 < kvv> probono: I was curious which project(s) you were trying to build in DarwinBuild, so I could focus on the dependencies for those
20:47 < probono> kvv: i was trying to build boot-132
20:47 < kvv> semilia|off: sounds familiar, but it's been a couple years since I played with booting x86
20:48 < probono> need the build log?
20:48 < kvv> probono: sure
20:48 < semilia|off> kvv: problem is b0 works but installing boot1 ...
20:49 < semilia|off> probono: i can send you fixed sources if you need
20:50 < probono> http://rafb.net/p/HV72Qh87.txt is the build log
20:50 < probono> cc: Command not found
20:51 < probono> semilia|off: the "HFS+ partition error" message is produced by boot1, i'm looking at the source
20:52 < semilia|off> boot1 install does NOT lead to HFS+ it ends ina single _
20:52 < kvv> do you have a boot partition?
20:52 < semilia|off> hfs+ is onyl shown if i dd it to mbr but that is defenetly not what i want
20:53 < semilia|off> partition is all fine and set active
20:54 < kvv> semilia|off: do you have the patch for boot?
20:54 < semilia|off> for compile it proper? sure
20:54 < kvv> thanks!
21:02 < probono> semilia|off:
21:02 < probono> ; Set to 1 to enable obscure debug messages.
21:02 < probono> ;
21:02 < probono> DEBUG                EQU  0
21:02 < probono> maybe that helps you find the problem
21:02 < probono> (it's from boot1.s)
21:03 < semilia|off> lol
21:04 < semilia|off> http://packages.puredarwin.org/files/boot-132-apic.zip <- fixed boot sources
21:09 < kvv> semilia|off: unzip doesn't like that file...
21:09 < kvv> oh, it's a 404
21:09 < semilia|off> fixed
21:10 < kvv> patches are easier ;)
22:07 < semilia|off> kvv: any success?
22:07 < kvv> semilia|off: yes.
22:08 < kvv> semilia|off: i keep finding reasons to rebuild stuff.  narrowing in on a set of packages to upload.
22:08 < kvv> thanks for the patch.
22:10 < semilia|off> you can tell my anything on active/not-active partions and boot0?
22:11 < probono> semilia|off: is there a changelog for the patch?
22:11 < probono> i.e., what does it do
22:12 < vmlemon> It burns a hole in the ceiling, and kidnaps your neighbour's child ;)
22:13 < semilia|off> probono: i comment a unused var causeing trouble and readded a missing header file which seems to get lost
22:13 < probono> ok
22:15 < kvv> the header change isn't necessary with DarwinBuild, but commenting the unused variable is.
22:24 < kvv> that's one example of a header not being installed on a Mac OS X system, but which is available via open source
22:24 < kvv> DarwinBuild installs those headers
22:26  * probono starts really liking DarwinBuild
22:26 < kvv> you'll like it more once I actually get it working for you ;)
22:28 < semilia|off> if a working enviorment is available i will consider having a look :)
22:30 < semilia|off> strange errors with boot ...
22:30 < semilia|off> if i set partition active i get "_"
22:30 < probono> did you turn the "obscure error messages" on?
22:30 < semilia|off> if not i get b0 error but boot1 never works
22:30 < bbraun> building without darwinbuild, expecially without understanding B&I's build system, is just a waste of time.
22:31 < semilia|off> bbraun: if there is a working darwinbuild, ok but so far there is not or at least nothing i considre working for me (updated)
22:32 < probono> if we used 10.4.8 for now i guess everything would work in darwinbuild?
22:34 < kvv> no
22:37 < probono> does anyone know a good mac mini colocation hoster?
22:37 < semilia|off> may i ask a question what partition type 0xab is?
22:37 < semilia|off> afaik hfs+ is af?
22:37 < probono> 0x0af
22:37 < vmlemon> Boot partition
22:37 < semilia|off> 0xaf == af
22:38 < probono> yes
22:38 < probono> that's hfs+
22:38 < probono> ab= Apple's OS-X (Darwin Intel) uses this type for its boot partition. The image (/usr/standalone/i386/boot) starts at sector 1. See also type a8.
22:38 < vmlemon> AB is the Mac OS X/Darwin Boot Partition
22:38 < probono> source http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/partitions/partition_types-1.html
22:39 < vmlemon> What a coincidence, I happened to be looking at the exact same page, a few seconds before ;)
22:39 < probono> i guess that's an outdated format?
22:39 < semilia|off> well that is asome neccessary info :)
22:40 < semilia|off> bootloader looks for a ab partition
22:40 < vmlemon> I don't know if anyone uses the Boot Partition, at least I've never used one with Darwin
22:41 < semilia|off> yeah baby i got it :)
22:41 < semilia|off> stage 2 complete
22:42 < probono> what caused it?
22:42 < semilia|off> boot1 requires an ab partition to look for i gues i need to change this
22:43 < probono> maybe use boot1_h_?
22:43 < vmlemon> As far as I know, the AB partition is only generated when using the boothfs and bootufs styles when formatting
22:43 < vmlemon> At least here with hfs style, an AB partition isn't generated, and it still works
22:44 < probono> http://lists.apple.com/archives/Darwinos-users/2003/Nov/msg00110.html
22:45 < vmlemon> Does anyone here actually have an AB partition? (Presumably as a result of using the boothfs/bootufs style)
22:45 < probono> semilia|off: the link above is really worth reading
22:46 < probono> has the "Someone needs to write some actual code" already happened since then?
22:46 < probono> is that what startupfiletool does?
22:46 < vmlemon> That's what bootufs and boothfs styles would do, normally?
22:50 < probono> boothfs and bootufs use that 8mb auxiliary partition, which is not a common setup any more
22:54 < semilia|off> wow i patched the bootloader now i get at least H_ lol
22:58 < probono> semilia|off: boot1_h_?
23:02 < semilia|off> no i get H_ on boot witha hfs+ partition
23:03 < probono> yes, but what file have you dd't to the first 512 bytes of the partition?
23:04 < semilia|off> 0
23:04 < semilia|off> all ok now boot0 is in first were it belongs and always was
23:04 < probono> boot0 goes to the first 446 bytes of the _hard disk_
23:04 < semilia|off> MBR
23:04 < semilia|off> and boot1h in first 512 of partition
23:04 < probono> boot1_h_ goes to the first 512 of the _parition_
23:04 < probono> yes
23:04 < probono> :)
23:05 < probono> and that should work without special patches i guess
23:05 < semilia|off> no
23:05 < semilia|off> it wants an ab partioiton (as i said earlier)
23:05 < probono> bbraun, can you confirm this?
23:05 < probono> then we are maybe doing something wrong
23:05 < bbraun> confirm which?  the requirement of an ab partition?
23:07 < probono> that boot1h needs an ab partition, unless patched
23:07 < semilia|off> probono: if you look into bootloader source you see it has a var which says it wants "ab", if you do so and give it a ab it finds it
23:07 < probono> or should we use another boot1* instead of h?
23:07 < semilia|off> u is ufs, no good
23:08 < bbraun> I know it used to require it.  I *believe* that requirement was removed in later versions, but I cannot say for sure.
23:08 < bbraun> boot2 used to reside on the ab partition
23:08 < semilia|off> well later versions not available opensource as i guess

16:59 < probono> hi semilia|off
16:59 < semilia|off> hi
17:00 < probono> i'm compiling boot, have successfully built boot0 and 1 but struggle with 2
17:00 < probono> what command did you use to compile boot2?
17:00 < semilia|off> what is your problem with boot2?
17:01 < semilia|off> well if you use my patched source standalone go in boot2 and type make install386 or something like that check in makefile for yntax
17:01 < probono> cd boot2 && make
17:01 < probono> graphics.c:629: warning: unused variable 'color'
17:01 < probono> make: *** [graphics.o] Error 1
17:02 < probono> (this is the unpatched one though)
17:02 < semilia|off> you are not using my patchs
17:03 < probono> the patched one gives: cd boot2 && make
17:03 < probono> make: Nothing to be done for `all'.
17:03 < semilia|off> as i said there is a param to make needed
17:04 < probono> install_i386 maybe
17:04 < semilia|off> yes
17:05 < probono> i686-apple-darwin8-gcc-4.0.1: boot2.o: No such file or directory
17:05 < semilia|off> something is not ok with your enviorment
17:08 < semilia|off> build others first
17:08 < semilia|off> than build boot2
17:09 < probono> ok
17:20 < probono> semilia|off: i have to do an extra cp ../../obj/i386/boot2/* .
17:20 < probono> then it appears to work
17:25  * semilia|off made it work
17:25 < semilia|off> woot :)
17:25 < probono> wow
17:26 < semilia|off> debug guide me my way :P
17:26 < probono> that's cool
17:26 < semilia|off> now i need to creat a /Lib/Pref/SyConf/com.apple lol
17:27 < semilia|off> but before i need to buy somthing to drink :)
17:27 < semilia|off> bbiaf
17:32  * probono thinks he has seen in the source that you can put the boot.plist directly in /
17:32 < probono> (but double check that pls)
17:33 < probono> strings boot | grep Boot.plist
17:33 < probono>  /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist
17:33 < probono>  /com.apple.lre.Boot.plist
17:33 < probono>  /com.apple.Boot.plist
17:52 < semilia|off> woot kernel starts :D
17:52 < vmlemon> Yay
17:54 < semilia|off> now comes the nice part.. acpi
17:56 < probono> try platform=X86PC
17:57 < probono> maybe that goes around acpi altogether
17:57  * probono had to use this woth darwin 8.0.1 on his celeron 400mhz
17:58 < semilia|off> that param is obslete from what i can tell
18:01 < probono> semilia|off: did you use a stock boot1h and stock boot2, or which of those needed patching
18:02 < semilia|off> i patched the boot2 filesys type to 0xaf in source
18:03 < probono> ok
20:51 < semilia|off> so far so good, all boots fine, well only thing missing is a up-to-date acpi now :)
20:53 < vmlemon> Isn't the ACPI stuff all in binary only blobs? Or is some of it open?
20:54 < semilia|off> not a bloob but a binary
20:55 < vmlemon> OK
20:59 < probono> didn't kvv mention acpi was not important?
21:04 < semilia|off> well minimum that important it panics without it :P
21:15 < probono> ich habs vielleicht
21:15 < probono> hold on
23:33 < probono> the most up-to-date acpi binary i am able to locate dates back to darwin 8.0
23:39 < semilia|off> "well only thing missing is a up-to-date acpi now :)" <- same :P
23:42 < semilia|off> i need sleep gn8
23:42 < probono> gn8

15:57 < vmlemon> Hi
16:12 < probono> welcome back
20:20 < kvv> howdy
20:20 < vmlemon> Hi
20:22 < kvv> getting reasonably close to having enough of a DarwinBuild environment set up for 10.4.8.x86 in order to bootstrap the rest.
20:58 < probono> hi kvv, that's good news
20:59 < probono> kvv, do the 8.0.1 BinaryDrivers still work?
20:59 < kvv> we'll see ;)
20:59 < kvv> i might be able to rustle up newer versions of the drivers
21:00 < kvv> but some of them might not even be built anymore (like SMBIOS)
21:00 < kvv> i haven't looked into it yet
21:00 < semilia|off> i have those
21:01 < semilia|off> build
21:03 < probono> semilia|off: what do you mean, what do you have build?
21:04 < probono> kvv, good, that means that at least someone still has the source to these :-)
21:05 < semilia|off> smbios
21:05 < semilia|off> the onyl changes they made is they made it efi dependant
21:05 < semilia|off> one function
21:06 < probono> uh-ah, that's the mentioned dropping of bios
21:06 < kvv> probono: the old sources are still available
21:09 < semilia|off> there is much more "drop" of
21:11 < semilia|off> kvv: can you give me a hint towards "waiting for root-device", i.e. what should go next there?
21:12 < kvv> do you have a blessed HFS+ partition?
21:12 < vmlemon> Is it normal for the installation CD to say "Welcome to the installation of", when it can't detect any/refuse to work with drives?
21:12 < semilia|off> it finds boot-volume
21:13 < semilia|off> tells me the boot-volumes uuid and enters a loop waiting for root device
21:13 < probono> vmlemon: i think i had that before
21:13 < kvv> sometimes waiting for root device is a sign that your IDE controller isn't supported
21:13 < semilia|off> i dunno what it expects now
21:13 < semilia|off> vmware
21:13 < probono> semilia|off: did you give it a rd=
21:13 < semilia|off> "<semilia|off> tells me the boot-volumes uuid and enters a loop waiting for root device"
21:14 < probono> vmlemon: let me check
21:15 < probono> vmlemon, changing the DVD drive jumper from cable select to Master solved my installer issue
21:16 < vmlemon> I'm sure it's always supposed to say "Welcome to Darwin $VERSION", instead of just "Welcome to the installation of"
21:16 < probono> "Welcome to the installation of" `grep 'Darwin [0-9.-]*' /Release\ Notes.txt | head -1 | awk '{print $1" "$2}'`
21:16 < vmlemon> Unless it's a glitch of some kind
21:16 < probono> so it can't find the Release Notes
21:17 < probono> is your disc ok?
21:17 < vmlemon> Yes
21:17 < probono> you could try booting in single user mode and check whether you can read the Release Notes correctly
21:17 < vmlemon> It was correctly burned, stored safely, and has no scratches or marks on it
21:18 < vmlemon> I tried booting with platform=X86PC -f from the CD, and the same happens
21:18 < probono> -f ?
21:18 < vmlemon> Safe mode
21:19 < vmlemon> According the the bootloader help
21:19 < probono> try single, -s
21:20 < vmlemon> -s gets me into a shell
21:20 < vmlemon> Not sure if I can do anything with the HDD, though
21:20 < probono> you can mount it
21:21 < probono> but first check what
21:21 < probono> cat /Release\ Notes.txt
21:21 < probono> gives
21:21 < vmlemon> The disk appears to be detected in /dev
21:21 < vmlemon> The main partition is ext3, though
21:23 < vmlemon> "Extension "com.apple.iokit.IOUSBMassStorageClass" has no kernel dependency" is normal when trying to use USB Mass Storage devices?
21:24 < kvv> there is no normal when it comes to darwin :)
21:25 < vmlemon> I wonder if AMD+VIA has anything to do with my woes
21:25 < probono> vmlemon: i also had problems using usb mass storage devices while running the darwin 801 iso
21:25 < semilia|off> kvv: please see my pm
21:25 < vmlemon> Num Lock doesn't work, either
21:26 < vmlemon> (on a USB keyboard)
21:26 < probono> booting the iso with plugged-in USB drive gives:
21:26 < probono> USBF: AppleUSBEHCI[0xc181b800]::Found a transaction past the completion deadline on bus 253, timing out!
21:26 < probono> USBF: AppleUSBEHCI[0xc181b800]::Found a transaction past the completion deadline on bus 253, timing out!
21:26 < probono> USBF: AppleUSBEHCI[0xc181b800]::Found a transaction which hasn't moved in 5 seconds on bus 253, timing out!
21:26 < probono> this was on a fairly recent intel machine
21:27 < vmlemon> How do I start the installer in Single User Mode?
21:27 < probono> -s
21:27 < probono> vmlemon: try one thing please:
21:27 < vmlemon> I'm in SUM, but I want to actually install Darwin to the HDD
21:27 < kvv> semilia|off: i did not receive any
21:27 < semilia|off> ?
21:27 < probono> try kextloading IOUSBFamily.kext
21:27 < semilia|off> kvv: now?
21:27 < probono> semilia|off: that's maybe because one of your nicks isn't properly registered
21:28 < probono> i guess pm works only when  both are registered on freenode
21:28 < semilia|off> mine
21:28 -!- semilia|off is now known as semilia
21:28 < vmlemon> probono: I get "Illegal Instruction", and then it exits
21:28 < kvv> vmlemon: need SSE3
21:29 < probono> kvv: for 801.iso? mine ran on a 400 mhz celeron
21:30 < vmlemon> Hmm, VMware presents the host's CPU info to the guest OS, and mine doesn't support SSE3, unless the magic VMware SSE3 Pixies have done something for Darwin
21:30 < vmlemon> I'm trying to install it on the AMD laptop at the moment, which also doesn't have SSE3
21:30 < semilia> kvv: did you get my msg now?
21:30 < probono> vmlemon: before you reboot:
21:31 < probono> you can install darwin w/o the installer, by typing the commands by hand ;)
21:31 < vmlemon> I'm going to try and fdisk the HDD with an autostyle
21:31 < probono> ok
21:31 < kvv> semilia: yes
21:32 < vmlemon> My HDD is sucessfully detected as /dev/rdisk0 in SUM, and fdisk shows the Linux ext3 and swap partitions on it
21:33 < vmlemon> Why it doesn't work outside of Single User Mode, I don't know
21:33 < probono> well i guess you need to format it
21:34 < vmlemon> It should just show the HDD, and give me the option of formatting it in the install phase, which it doesn't
21:35 < vmlemon> I can't seem to format the HDD or partition it with fdisk, and trying to use pdisk results in "Illegal instruction"
21:37 < vmlemon> I wiped the MBR and made a fresh one, and then I was able to format with the HFS autostyle
21:37  * probono will be blaming the amd + via chipset if things won't work
21:39 < vmlemon> I can't start newfs_hfs to format the partition, thanks to the "Illegal instruction" error, yet again :/
21:40 < vmlemon> That's fun, it's gave me a "Memory access exception (1,2,40)" error whilst trying to reboot, and appears to have kernel panicked
21:41  * probono blames the amd + via chipset
21:41 < vmlemon> I'm starting to blame it, now
21:42 < semilia> you can blame via for anything
21:42 < semilia> via is devil
21:43  * probono remembers this SiS system which went on eBay practically immediately
21:44 < vmlemon> Acer Aspire 1350 laptop
21:44 < semilia> ok so we make a list of worse vendors.. via and sis are very close to the very end
21:46 < vmlemon> I think the Acer Aspire 1350 is firmly at the top of the Non-Darwin Friendly list
21:47 < vmlemon> (For vendors and products), and the Via and SiS chipsets probably score highly on the Non-Darwin Friendly list
21:48 < probono> i was really suprised to see that darwin has a VIA ATA kext
21:48 < vmlemon> We ought to have a list of "Good" and "Bad" products and vendors on the wiki
21:49 < probono> it's called a Harware Compatibility List, probably there already exists one on opendarwin
21:49 < vmlemon> Well, true
21:49 < vmlemon> If the HCL is even on OpenDarwin, still
21:50 < vmlemon> In my opinion, Apple hardware products don't count
21:50 < vmlemon> For obvious reasons
21:56 < probono> well maybe someone wants to try darwin on a Macintosh Plus :)
21:57 < probono> do you even remember what that is
21:57 < vmlemon> Wouldn't happen, since it's not PowerPC
21:57 < vmlemon> There's always the non-PPC Apple Lisa ;)
21:59 < vmlemon> Darwin on a BeBox might have been interesting
22:01 < vmlemon> If I still had my Macintosh Performa 6400/180, I could have tried Darwin on that, but it probably wouldn't have worked at all
22:03 < vmlemon> After all, my experiments with LinuxPPC on the thing were hardly stellar successes
22:04 < vmlemon> Plus, the hardware on it was increadibly meagre

16:45 < vmlemon> Hi
16:49 < mynameisdelete1> hi
16:49 < probono> hi
16:50 < mynameisdelete1> you know anything about OSX on linux/
16:50 < mynameisdelete1> I got compressed dmg2iso converter
16:50 < mynameisdelete1> got .app loader with modification-needed cocoa implementation
16:50 < mynameisdelete1> I think I found a dyld loader
16:51 < probono> what are you trying to do?
16:51 < vmlemon> Interesting 
16:51 < mynameisdelete1> I'm trying to run OSX apps in linux
16:51 < probono> ah
16:51 < mynameisdelete1> I'll try to theme modified gnustep to look like OSX widgets rather than old ones too
16:51 < mynameisdelete1> so with beryl
16:51 < vmlemon> It'll take some work to hammer Mach-O support into the Linux kernel
16:51 < mynameisdelete1> it might look like OSX
16:52 < mynameisdelete1> there is a way to get qemu-user to run the dynamic loaders and provide mach compat
16:52 < mynameisdelete1> I found on the opendarwin site
16:52 < probono> even if you get mach-o support you will lack lots of apple proprietary frameworks, so yo won't be able to run mac apps on linux
16:52 < mynameisdelete1> my first step is get 1 app to run any way I can under linux
16:52 < mynameisdelete1> even if it's a virtual machien to start with
16:52 < mynameisdelete1> then I can make more compatability
16:52 < mynameisdelete1> and maybe make more apps
16:53 < probono> doesn't quemu allow one to run mach-o binaries on linux?
16:53 < mynameisdelete1> wine started with just support for notepad and that's it
16:53 < vmlemon> Thought about leveraging Darwin components for what you're trying to do?
16:53 < mynameisdelete1> I'm looking at which ones I can
16:53 < mynameisdelete1> I think if I get one or 2 apps actually running , and have a site up for it
16:53 < mynameisdelete1> it will maybe generate some interest
16:54 < mynameisdelete1> and other people might help making it support more apps
16:54 < vmlemon> I wouldn't focus on getting Aqua and such running on a Linux kernel, for obvious reasons
16:54 < mynameisdelete1> if it has a cvs tree
16:55 < mynameisdelete1> cocoa and quartz might be much better documented than most windows apis are on msdn
16:55 < probono> well i'd say: good luck! wine took tens of years and still can't run everything
16:55 < mynameisdelete1> so it might be that it will progress much faster and better than wine
16:55 < vmlemon> I wouldn't use any components from Mac OS X, if I was doing it to distribute
16:55 < probono> there are private frameworks which aren't documented at all
16:56 < mynameisdelete1> 3rd party apps though use only apple frameworks they can get documentation for
16:56 < probono> yes, but those apple frameworks can use what they want
16:56 < mynameisdelete1> it might be that large companies have licenses with apple to get the proprietary parts of their documentation
16:56 < vmlemon> That may be likely
16:57 < mynameisdelete1> OSX compat has to start somewhere
16:57 < mynameisdelete1> what do you think the simplest OSX universal binary is?
16:57 < mynameisdelete1> that only uses cocoa for gui?
16:58 < vmlemon> Get something like mkdir or bash Darwin binaries working, before anything else
16:58 < mynameisdelete1> yup
16:59 < vmlemon> Building a compatibility system for running Aqua applications from scratch is probably safer than using Apple components, but it'd take longer
16:59 < mynameisdelete1> I'll look at this more later
17:00 < vmlemon> As for Cocoa, some parts are replicated by GNUStep, but not all of it is
17:01 < vmlemon> Carbon is a different animal, if you want compatibility with it
17:02 < vmlemon> I don't know of anyone who uses pure Carbon still, either
17:02 < mynameisdelete1> I'll prob give up on that
17:02 < mynameisdelete1> the carbon
17:02 < mynameisdelete1> maybe my first app will be open source
17:03 < mynameisdelete1> snice that's prob easiest
17:03 < vmlemon> The GNU utilities are probably the best bet
17:03 < mynameisdelete1> maybe just the demos
17:03 < vmlemon> (ensuring that you use precompiled Mach-O binaries)
17:04 < vmlemon> Unless you want to suffer the pain of trying to build a Mach-O and Darwin toolchain on Linux
17:04 < mynameisdelete1> my goal is prob to get far enough to make it an actual project people can build on
17:04 < mynameisdelete1> I've done tool-chains before for embeded
17:07 < vmlemon> You could help us work towards a bootable foundation for PureDarwin, if you wanted to
17:09 < vmlemon> Since Macintoshes are now Intel based, and Darwin runs on x86, you wouldn't need to worry about CPU/architecture emulation
17:11 < vmlemon> A Wine style system might be workable, if you could build Mach-O binary support into it, and try to use the Darwin components
17:28 < probono> mynameisdelete1: do i understand it right that you try to do 2 things: 1) make linux run mach-o and 2) update gnustep to run mac os x apps ?
17:33 < vmlemon> I guess that's his idea in a nutshell
17:33 < probono> so i would recmomend to investigate 1) qemu and 2) gnustep, and understand why 2) gave up ;)
17:37 < vmlemon> NetBSD had experimental Mach-O support, but I don't know if it'd still work with today's Darwin and Mac OS X Mach-O binaries
19:56 < mynameisdelete1> yup

20:46 < vmlemon> Any more progress?
20:47 < vmlemon> WTF, two different ring tones layered on top of each other, when using SkypeOut (SkypeOut tone and UK tone)
20:47 < kvv> howdy
20:48 < vmlemon> Oops, wrong channel
20:51 < vmlemon> kvv: Hi
20:51 < kvv> hi
20:54 < vmlemon> Any more progress in the bootloader + kernel department?
20:58 < kvv> no idea
21:17 < probono> vmlemon: we're still waiting for root device ;)
21:18 < vmlemon> Still?
21:18 < probono> still.
21:18 < vmlemon> Didn't they deliver it? ;)
21:18 < probono> i searched all amazon for root devices today
21:18 < vmlemon> Blame the delivery company 
21:18 < probono> but couldn't find one that i liked ;)
21:19 < vmlemon> Which colour?
21:19 < probono> silver, of course.
21:19 < vmlemon> With go faster stripes and hyper optimization? ;)
21:19 < probono> but they charge 200% for the silver ones :(
21:20 < vmlemon> Any specific make or model?
21:21 < vmlemon> Of course, they probably have to custom make it ;)
21:22 < probono> model hexley fits best i guess
21:22 < vmlemon> Silver Hexley with Apple decals?
21:22 < vmlemon> Or just a stock Silver Hexley?
21:23 < probono> they told me i should wait for another year, when the new model comes out. model hurd
21:23 < probono> a very solid root device.
21:24 < vmlemon> Aah, wasn't Hurd rendered obsolete by the Hexley model before it even came off the production line?
21:24 < probono> true, that's how it was
21:25 < vmlemon> I hear that they're custom building Hexley+s in Japan, at the moment
21:25 < vmlemon> And it's economically friendly, compared to the original model Hexley ;)
21:26 < vmlemon> *environmentally and economically friendly
21:27 < vmlemon> It's 25% faster, and has better Japanese language support
21:28 < vmlemon> (Due to all the Hexley+ corporate slogan decals on the side of it)
21:28 < kvv> probono: DarwinBuild should be in good shape now
21:28 < kvv> probono: i recommend updating to the latest SVN and re-installing it.
21:28 < probono> kvv: that's great news!
21:29  * probono goes getting it from svn
21:29 < kvv> probono: then you should be able to do:   mkdir 8P2137 ; cd 8P2137 ; darwinbuild -init 8P2137 ; darwinbuild boot
21:29 < kvv> and it'll work automagically
21:32 < vmlemon> probono: See, since the DarwinBuild tool was repaired, they can produce the Silver Hexley much faster ;
21:32 < vmlemon> ;)
22:24 < probono> hmm, i'm getting
22:24 < probono> cc1: warnings being treated as errors
22:24 < probono> graphics.c: In function 'setBorderColor':

14:03 -!- apic_ [n=apic@p548EEDE3.dip.t-dialin.net] has joined #puredarwin
14:20 -!- fkr [i=fkr@news.bytemine.net] has joined #puredarwin
14:22 < probono> hi fkr
14:23 < fkr> hi
14:23 < fkr> so
14:23 < fkr> what is puredarwin?
14:24 < probono> the preliminary mission statement is:
14:24 < probono> "To promote the use and development of pure Darwin as an Open Source operating system."
14:24 < fkr> like GNU-darwin
14:24 < fkr> ?
14:24 < vmlemon> No
14:24 < vmlemon> Similar, but different
14:25  * probono doesn't know too much about gnu-darwin besides they protest against a lot of things
14:25 < probono> executive summary:
14:25 < probono> Darwin doesn't suck enough to be forgotten. Hence, the PureDarwin project was born after OpenDarwin's vanishing. It will be 50% a documentation effort and 50% a building effort.
14:25 < vmlemon> We're trying to use all of the Apple-supplied components as-is, to build our system
14:26 < fkr> ah
14:28 < vmlemon> Hence "Pure"
14:29 < probono> it's not yet officially announed
14:30 < vmlemon> To rephrase ReactOS, "In short, PureDarwin is aiming to run your applications and use your hardware" (unless someone disagrees)
14:30 < probono> fkr: i understand you are one of the main devs of DarwinPorts
14:30  * probono has been playing with MacPorts all day long
14:30 < fkr> you understand wrong :)
14:31 < fkr> I _was_ one of the main guys behind DarwinPorts for a while
14:31 < fkr> same goes for OpenDarwin
14:31 < probono> cool!
14:31 < fkr> but that's more than couple years ago
14:32 < probono> we'd be interested in what you think about our project
14:33 < fkr> i doubt that :)
14:33 < probono> why?
14:34 < probono> full unsweetened honesty please :)
14:34 < fkr> the only reason I see for puredarwin to exist is for educational reasons
14:34 < vmlemon> We are genuinely interested in your opinion, and value it highly (or something like that)
14:35 < fkr> are you guys running darwin by itself?
14:35 < fkr> or are you running mac os x?
14:35 < vmlemon> Yes, we're building on Darwin, and intend to build a standalone OS
14:36 < probono> yes, "pure"
14:36 < fkr> thats not my question :)
14:36 < fkr> my question was: are you running darwin?
14:36 < probono> basically we're interested in a up-to-date version of the darwin 8.0.1 iso
14:36 < probono> which we are currently running
14:36 < vmlemon> fkr: Using Darwin as our day-to-day system for doing stuff on?
14:36 < probono> from there, we want to add stuff from macports and/or fink
14:36 < fkr> vmlemon: exactly
14:36 < probono> not really day-to-day
14:37 < probono> yet ;)
14:37 < fkr> my point
14:37 < vmlemon> I use Linux (Gentoo), at the moment
14:37 < probono> more like for special purposes
14:37 < fkr> that is exactly my point
14:37 < fkr> what is the special purpose?
14:37 < fkr> (except for building darwin, of course)
14:37 < probono> there used to be a whole wiki page on that put got pulled when people laughed at it
14:38 < vmlemon> Probably, to learn more about the OS, so we can improve upon it and build our OS project
14:38 < fkr> don't get me wrong, but one of the reasons why I dropped working on darwin is, because I saw no sense in it _except_ for educating myself
14:38 < vmlemon> "It's exclusive, it's exciting and participation is free." Is that reason enough? ;)
14:39 < fkr> hehe
14:39 < probono> fkr: we also think due to the intel switch the whole platform has much more potential now
14:39 < probono> 20x the installed base of potentially capable hardware
14:39 < probono> 20x the potential developers
14:44 < vmlemon> And, the potential for a large userbase
14:45 < apic_> what is on here?
14:47 < probono> apic_: we're introducing fkr (long-time darwin contributor) to the project
14:49 < fkr> well, i'm looking forward to see what you make of it :)
14:49 < fkr> good luck anyways
14:51 < probono> thanks fkr
14:53 < vmlemon> fkr: You're welcome to help, if you ever want to
14:53 < fkr> i will stick to openbsd :)
14:54 < probono> fkr: for general purpose everyday tasks?
14:54 < fkr> yes
14:55 < vmlemon> We even take help on improving PureDarwin from Windows users ;)
14:58 < probono> fkr: does it run on the mac?
15:00 < fkr> of course
15:01 < probono> including wireless drivers and such?
15:03 < fkr> depends on which chipset is being used
15:04 < fkr> apple uses lots of crappy brodcom chips
15:06 < vmlemon> The Apple AirPort cards that were installed inside PowerPC machines (e.g. iMacs) were just PCMCIA cards, weren't they?
15:06 < vmlemon> Or did they just look superficially similar?
15:10 < probono> the first series were re-labeled lucent wavelan
15:10 < probono> i still have such a card
15:10  * probono will try whether he can get a darwin driver for it
15:10 < vmlemon> Thanks, I was just wondering
15:11 < vmlemon> As far as I know, Darwin already has a closed AirPort driver in it (or at least it did at one point)
15:14 < fkr> yes
15:14 < fkr> there is a driver for that in darwin
15:14 < fkr> but no utility to configure the card with
15:14 < fkr> as such it would just join the stronges open network available
15:14 < fkr> this is as of 7.2.1
15:14 < fkr> :)
15:15 < fkr> see also
15:15 < fkr> http://hazardous.org/~fkr/archive/od_fkr_public_html/
15:15 < fkr> thats the archive of my website from back then
15:15 < fkr> there are some informations to be found there
15:15 < vmlemon> In theory, the ndiswrapper could be ported from Linux to Darwin, if someone really wanted to
15:16 < vmlemon> But it's an ugly way of doing things
15:17 < fkr> http://hazardous.org/~fkr/archive/od_fkr_public_html/ODWireless/ODWireless-1.tar.gz
15:17 < fkr> there for example
15:17 < fkr> vmlemon: i thought, you were interested in an _open_ source darwin
15:17 < vmlemon> I am
15:17 < fkr> ndiswrapper is everything but open source
15:18 < vmlemon> As I said, it's ugly. It involves encapsulating closed blobs in GPL'd (?) driver code, and I doubt if the licensing would let you do it
15:18 < vmlemon> (Since xnu is APSL)
15:18 < fkr> http://hazardous.org/~fkr/archive/od_fkr_public_html/ODWireless/ODWireless.txt
15:19 < vmlemon> Also, I don't have any Wi-Fi hardware, so it's moot for me
15:22 < apic_> wait for my the base i got here to finsih propper than we can talk on future of puredarwin, as noone yet saw anything i am not sure why people think this project will be dead birth lol
15:23 < vmlemon> It's only a week old or so, maybe a bit longer
15:23 < vmlemon> So it can't really be dead
15:24 < fkr> well. you guys should try to convince others by actions not by talk that the project is not a deadborn
15:25 < vmlemon> We are working feverishly to build the latest available kernel and get it to boot
15:26 < vmlemon> And we're making progress on that, as with the bootloader
15:26 < vmlemon> But it's too early to announce anything
15:30 < vmlemon> The idea is to get the bootloader to work, the kernel to boot, and to try and get the kernel to compile on the system itself, without resorting to Mac OS X
15:42 < probono> fkr: thanks for your links

18:47 < vmlemon> Hi
20:25 < kvv> probono: is DarwinBuild working out for you now that I posted the 10.4.8.x86 roots?
20:26 < probono> kvv, maybe i was doing something wrong yesterday, but following your instructions gave me an error while building boot
20:26  * fkr pokes kvv
20:26 < kvv> probono: boot needs to be patched, remember?
20:26 < fkr> :-}
20:26 < kvv> fkr: howdy!
20:26 < fkr> lo
20:26 < fkr> whats up :)
20:26 < probono> kvv: ok, that might of course be the solution :)
20:28 < kvv> fkr: the usual :)
20:30 < kvv> probono: try this: darwinxref edit 8L2127 boot
20:30 < kvv> (from your working directory of course)
20:30 < kvv> then add the following key:
20:30 < kvv> patchfiles = ( "boot-132.p1.patch" );
20:30 < kvv> it should build after that
20:31 < probono> w00t! i just replaced the boot- with the patched version and it worked like a charm. your solution is better though kvv
20:31 < kvv> cool
20:31 < probono> :)
20:37 < probono> kvv, does macosforge collect patches, and is there a preferred way to submit them?
20:58 < kvv> probono: yeah I'd like to host patches for compile issues like that
20:58 < kvv> probono: best way to submit them is to email me
20:59 < kvv> for now
20:59 < probono> all right
21:32 < vmlemon> Can we compile this stuff on Darwin itself?
22:00 < probono> vmlemon: not tried yet

23:22 < kvv> vmlemon: cannot compile Xcode projects on Darwin
23:31 < fkr> history repeats itself
23:32 < vmlemon> Back to the start of the perpetual problem cycle :(
23:32 < vmlemon> We really could do with an "OXCode" (Open XCode)
23:33 < fkr> LOL
23:33 < vmlemon> Well, it's not the best name, but you've got the idea
23:36 < vmlemon> A Free Software, XCode compatible environment on which the tricky XCode only components can be built
23:37 < fkr> when are you done?
23:37 < vmlemon> Me?
23:37 < vmlemon> Or PureDarwin?
23:37 < fkr> yes
23:37 < fkr> with your OXCode
23:37 < vmlemon> I can't build it, but I have an idea, should someone want to take up the challenge
--- Day changed Sun Apr 29 2007
00:01 < kvv> I wrote an alternative to Xcode back when it was using the jam-based targets
00:01 < kvv> now they switched everything to native targets

22:42 < vmlemon> No, fkr
22:42 < fkr> zzz = nachti nachti = good night
22:42 < vmlemon> Aah, I see
22:42 < probono> i had just fallen asleep over the keyboard ;)
22:43 < vmlemon> #puredarwin's really quiet, tonight
22:44 < vmlemon> Any progress on anything?
22:44 < probono> that's because everyone's working on cooool stuff :)
22:44 < vmlemon> Aah
22:45 < vmlemon> They've got a fully booting system?
22:45 < probono> semilia_off had made progress towards this end
22:47 < vmlemon> Any more documentation progress?
22:48 < probono> i had fun with documenting kext dependencies lately
23:16 < kvv> heh
23:16 < kvv> just install them all!
23:16 < kvv> how's DarwinBuild working out?
23:17 < probono> kvv, thanks, it's going well
23:18 < probono> only thing currently is that it appears the kernel won't boot w/o the acpi kext, and that the binary-provided acpi kext is no longer compatible w/ the kernel
23:18 < vmlemon> Night, all
23:18 < probono> night vmlemon
23:19 < kvv> probono: OK.  We should be able to update the kext.  I'll let you know.
23:19 < probono> that'd be great
23:19 < apic_> kernel boots without it
23:20 < apic_> noone ever listen to me?
23:20 < vmlemon> We do listen
23:20 < probono> i'm not sure but i could imagine the BinaryDrivers do no longer work with the latest kernel
23:20 < probono> could totally be just me though
23:21 < apic_> they do not, i explained last week :P
23:21 < apic_> i got the whoel system boot based upon opensource components
23:22 < apic_> no need for propetery acpi kext
23:23 < apic_> so really noone listen to me x-)
23:23 < probono> apic_: we do
23:24 < probono> kvv: just built a system for graphing kext deps like http://tangerine.quickshareit.com/share/graph473a0.png
23:24 < probono> in order to figure out what is sufficient for a working system
23:25 < kvv> isn't there a boolean in the plist, OSBootRequired?
23:25  * probono is worried that the graphs quickly get at least as complex as those in singh's book ;)
23:25 < kvv> it's the flag that safeboot uses
23:25 < probono> kvv, it is, but it lists many, many things
23:26 < kvv> hurray for microoptimization ;)
23:26 < probono> wait until i have this thing running on my toaster ;-)
23:26 < apic_> my base system booted with liek 15 kext :-o
23:27 < probono> kvv, is there a RSS feed for the lists on macosforge?
23:27 < kvv> no
23:27 < probono> i was thinking of creating some sort of aggregator of all the different lists and feeds and forums
23:30  * probono is off for the next 30 mins
23:35 < apic_> kvv: the binarys in darwibuild buildroot are they redistributable in first palce or jsut copied from the system somewhere ?
23:38 < kvv> apic_: they're the product of building the open source code
23:39 < apic_> also the syscmds and stuff?
23:39 < apic_> i not saw them download and build
23:42 < kvv> yes, everything is downloaded from macosforge.org, except for Xcode.  Xcode is copied from the local system (when needed)

10:19 < probono> welcome :)
10:20 < FlameBird> thanks :)
10:20 < probono> so currently we are compiling darwin from source
10:20 < FlameBird> pretty neat!
10:20 < probono> to get started, you should look at the DarwinBuild tool
10:20 < FlameBird> I I SIR
10:21 < probono> unfortunately, darwinbuild appears to require xcode, which in turn requires an intel mac for building
10:21 < probono> however, there _might_ be workarounds
10:21 < probono> you could give it a try
10:22 < FlameBird> I sure will
10:22 < FlameBird> I think I will get darwin first
10:23 < probono> ok
10:23 < probono> after that:
10:23 < probono> mkdir darwinbuild
10:23 < probono> cd darwinbuild/
10:23 < probono> svn checkout http://svn.macosforge.org/repository/darwinbuild/trunk/
10:23 < probono> cd trunk/
10:23 < probono> make
10:23 < probono> make install
10:23 < probono> export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
10:23 < probono> darwinbuild -init 8P2137
10:24 < probono> darwinbuild xnu
10:24 < probono> should compile your 1st kernel :)
10:24 < vmlemon> Do we know why it requires XCode?
10:25 < probono> some projects are xcode projects and require xcode to build
10:25 < probono> however, darwinbuild comes with a tool that can install the necessary xcode-compilers into a pure darwin system
10:25 < vmlemon> I see
10:26 < probono> xocde is more or less a gui to open source compilers

15:21 < FlameBird> the damn opens like text!!!
15:21 < FlameBird> what crap!
15:21 < probono> use wget
15:22 < FlameBird> hmm
15:22 < apic_> or simple .. save as
15:22 < vmlemon> Ping
15:22 < FlameBird> Pong
15:22 < probono> pong
15:22 < probono> FlameBird: vmlemon can also explain you the first steps, he's done it before
15:23 < FlameBird> I will keep that in mind
15:24 < vmlemon> They're on the Wiki, but it's not open yet
15:25 < vmlemon> Unfortunately, I'm not sure if I still have my local copy of the instructions
15:25 < probono> i can send you a copy
15:25 < vmlemon> OK
15:25 < vmlemon> Just going to check
15:25 < FlameBird> what size is the iso?
15:25 < vmlemon> 800MB+, I think
15:26 < vmlemon> I still have it in Namikiteru
15:26 < FlameBird> how the hell will I write that to a CD-R?
15:26 < vmlemon> Just going to confirm the size
15:26 < probono> it fits on a DVD perfectly, in doubt
15:26 < vmlemon> I burnt it to a CD just fine
15:27 < FlameBird> I hope its <700mb I dont have a dvd burner
15:27 < vmlemon> DVDs are often fussy
15:28 < vmlemon> It's gzipped when you download it, the file is 408.4MB
15:29 < vmlemon> It'll fit on a CD perfectly
15:29 < FlameBird> nice!
15:29 < vmlemon> Of course, you have to extract it, first
15:29 < FlameBird> hmm
15:29 < FlameBird> 90 mb done
15:29 < vmlemon> Just going to check the extracted size
15:30 < vmlemon> 560.8MB extracted
15:30 < FlameBird> kinky!
15:30 < vmlemon> I burnt it with K3B without a hitch
15:30 < vmlemon> *burned
15:32 < FlameBird> is this same? http://www.opendarwin.org/downloads/8.0.1/darwinx86-801.iso.gz
15:32 < vmlemon> Yes
15:32 < vmlemon> It was the last ISO they made available
15:32 < FlameBird> hmm
15:32 < FlameBird> I need to read Darwin stuff now
15:32 < FlameBird> I am pretty much noob about these stuff
15:33 < vmlemon> Everything after that was shipped in source packages exclusively
15:33 < probono> precisely. darwinbuild is the environment for compiling the newer versions
15:33 < FlameBird> vmlemon, the size is around 378...
15:34 < FlameBird> 408.4?
15:34 < FlameBird> where did you get that from/
15:34 < FlameBird> is my iso wrong or something
15:35 < FlameBird> vmlemon, ?
15:35 < probono> 560,8 MB
15:35 < vmlemon> Did it fully download?
15:35 < probono> that's the real size
15:35 < FlameBird> I will extract and check
15:36 < probono> mine is working and the ISO is 560,8 MB for sure
15:36 < FlameBird> i was talking about the zipped file..
15:36 < vmlemon> To be precise, 587,997,186 bytes
15:36 < FlameBird> darwinx86-801.iso.gz
15:36 < probono> we
15:36 < probono> are referring to the unpacked one
15:36 < vmlemon> Yes

16:13 < probono> perfect
16:14 < FlameBird> :))
16:14 < probono> Booting Darwin CD from IDE (works)
16:14 < probono> This is on a i915 chipset, DVD drive attached to IDE:
16:14 < probono> IOATAController device blocking bus
16:14 < probono> AppleIntelPIIXPATA: ICH6 ATA/100 (CMD 0x1f0, CTR 0x3f4, IRQ 14 BM 0xffa0)
16:14 < probono> Still waiting for root device
16:14 < probono> Still waiting for root device
16:14 < probono> Still waiting for root device
16:14 < FlameBird> probono, are you on OsX or Darwin?
16:14 < probono> Changing the DVD drive jumper from cable select to Master solved this issue.
16:14 < probono> It boots up and asks where to install Darwin.
16:14 < FlameBird> probono, k
16:15 < probono> i have all sorts of machines and systems here :)
16:15 < FlameBird> then?
16:15 < FlameBird> :)
16:15 < probono> it then asks where to install Darwin
16:15 < vmlemon> If you have two DVD drives (e.g. a DVD-ROM and a DVD burner), putting it in the burner works for me
16:15 < probono> During installation, a lot of .root.tar.bz2 files are uncompressed
16:16 < FlameBird> k
16:16 < FlameBird> anything else I need to know?
16:16 < probono> in the end, installer  asks for a root password
16:16 < probono> and for a computer name (Bonjour hostname)
16:16 < probono> and then you should be all set to boot into Darwin
16:16 < FlameBird> ok
16:16 < FlameBird> what about bootloader?
16:16 < vmlemon> It automatically installs it
16:16 < probono> it is installed automatically
16:16 < probono> and then comes the important trick:
16:16 < FlameBird> nice..
16:16 < FlameBird> hm?
16:16 < probono> If booted without any arguments, the boot fails. However, by entering
16:16 < probono> rd=disk0s1
16:16 < probono> Darwin fully boots into a login prompt.
16:17 < probono> The following procedure fixes the boot issue permanently:
16:17 < probono> mcedit /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist
16:17 < probono> # edit Boot.plist, remove "Boot Device" entry
16:17 < probono> reboot
16:17 < vmlemon> Then go nuts, and enjoy the ride! ;)
16:17 < FlameBird> lol
16:17 < probono> i had one additional issue (vmlemon, did you have that too?)
16:17 < vmlemon> Probably best to set up a seperate useer account for day to day stuff
16:17 < vmlemon> Which issue?
16:17 < probono> Trying to load IOUSBFamily.kext says "check ownership and permissions".
16:18 < vmlemon> I've never seen it happen before
16:18 < probono> ok
16:18 < FlameBird> how old are you guys? O.o
16:18 < vmlemon> That said, I've only ever installed it fully in a VM
16:18 < probono> ok
16:18 < FlameBird> I mean do you work somewhere?
16:18 < probono> we'll do a more formal round of introductions later :)
16:18 < vmlemon> We do know about my adventures of getting the CD to boot on my laptop (Via + AMD chipsets) :(
16:18 < FlameBird> well the cd is burning :D
16:19 < FlameBird> so I have time

16:53 < vmlemon> Yes
16:53 < probono> that's what i described above
16:53 < FlameBird> System Config File '/com.apple.boot.plist' not found
16:53 < FlameBird> so what do I do?
16:53 < probono> If booted without any arguments, the boot fails. However, by entering
16:53 < probono> rd=disk0s1
16:54 < probono> it works
16:54 < vmlemon> --platform=X86PC is sometimes also required
16:54 < vmlemon> * platform=X86PC that is
16:54 < FlameBird> how do I add that?
16:54 < vmlemon> You might not need it
16:54 < probono> just type it at the boot prompt
16:54 < probono> where it says Darwin/x86
16:54 < FlameBird> well that error comes before I can do anything
16:55 < probono> press f8 during boot
16:55 < FlameBird> and I am presented with hd(144,0) Ethernet PXE Client
16:55 < FlameBird> as boot option
16:55 < probono> that's great
16:55 < FlameBird> :S
16:55 < probono> there you should type that
16:55 < vmlemon> Something looks wrong
16:55 < vmlemon> It shouldn't try to present a NetBooting option
16:55 < probono> as long as you get messages like PXE that means you are in the boot loader
16:55 < probono> vmlemon: why not?
16:55 < vmlemon> Well, true
16:56  * probono thinks netbooting might actually work, if one knew how
16:56 < probono> it's documented nowhere

17:03 < vmlemon> When you boot from CD, does it say "Welcome to the installation of", and then hang?
17:03 < FlameBird> nope
17:03 < FlameBird> it doesnt even reach there
17:03 < FlameBird> the msg flashes
17:03 < vmlemon> SATA or PATA?
17:03 < FlameBird> PATA i guess..
17:04 < probono> ah i see, you can't even launch the installer?
17:04 < FlameBird> no
17:04 < FlameBird> when I boot
17:04 < FlameBird> the msg flashes
17:04 < FlameBird> and i get a prompt
17:04 < FlameBird> with the above boot option
17:04 < FlameBird> PXE one
17:04 < probono> it doesn't find the DVD drive
17:04 < FlameBird> maybe
17:04 < FlameBird> :S
17:04 < FlameBird> now what?
17:04 < probono> normally i would say: jumper it differently
17:05 < probono> but that's a notebook...
17:05 < probono> so actually i'm not sure what to do here
17:05 < probono> maybe someone in #opendarwin knows something
17:11 < apic_> you cannot do anything about this error immo
17:11 < apic_> its teh bootloader, one reason why i patched it :P

17:19 < FlameBird> :D
17:26 < probono> FlameBird: probably the mailing list is the best way to get answers for your problem
17:26 < FlameBird> probono, ok
17:27 < probono> http://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/darwin-x86
17:27 < probono> darwin-x86@lists.apple.com
17:28 < probono> chances of an answer are increased if you don't mention the insanely forum
17:29 < vmlemon> Some prefer here, if I-Mac isn't mentioned
17:54 < FlameBird> probono, I think I will have to wait for Pure Darwin
17:54 < probono> FlameBird: i think it's no use discussing further on opendarwin
17:54 < probono> opendarwin don't like running pure darwin any longer, it seems
17:55 < FlameBird> well I have no choice now it wont install and I cant change my hardware
17:55 < FlameBird> WHY THE HELL IS PURE DARWIN RELATED TO PIRACY?
17:56 < vmlemon> It is not!
17:56 < probono> it's not!
17:56 < FlameBird> I know
17:56 < FlameBird> what crap are they talkin on #opendarwin

17:58 < vmlemon> We have said from our inception that we will not allow our product to be abused, in order to achieve illegitimate Mac OS X on Dell/Gateway/HP. Yes, it's a grey area, but it's what was decided pretty much from day one.
17:59 < vmlemon> Drivers are another area with problems
