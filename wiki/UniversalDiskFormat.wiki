==References/More Information==
  * The current steward/maintainer of the UDF specifications is the [http://www.osta.org Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA)], who currently make them freely available [http://www.osta.org/specs/ here] as PDF files
  * Some information on various implementations is curated on the [UDFInteroperabilityTesting] page of this wiki
  * Additional factoids and information on UDF are also available over at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Disk_Format Wikipedia]

==Useful Tools==
===UDFClient===
  * [http://www.13thmonkey.org/udfclient UDFClient] includes a tool ({{{udfdump}}}) to print the structures of a UDF volume - requires BSD Make (AKA {{{bmake}}}) on some systems) 
  * For best results when using a disk-based file, instead of a device node attached to a physical drive, invoke {{{udfdump}}} using the arguments {{{-u 3 -S}}}
  * It may also be a good idea to specify the block size using {{{-b 512}}}, for example
