#summary Content related to the MIPS-based BT HomeHub

== General Overview ==

The BT Home Hub contains a 32-bit, MIPS architecture, Broadcom BCM6348KPBG/BCM6348 CPU, supporting ADSL2. Running the *nix {{{file}}} command on one of the binaries extracted from the router reported "{{{ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, version 1 (SYSV)}}}". A Linux kernel is used on the device, however a closed-source, proprietary userland application ({{{linux_appl.exe}}}) and a closed-source, proprietary kernel module ({{{nmon.ko}}}) are responsible for providing the Home Hub's functionality.
