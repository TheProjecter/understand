#summary Content related to the MIPS-based BT HomeHub

== General Overview ==

The BT Home Hub contains a 32-bit, MIPS architecture, Broadcom BCM6348KPBG/BCM6348 CPU, supporting ADSL2. Running the UNIX/Linux {{{file}}} command on one of the binaries extracted from the router reported "{{{ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, version 1 (SYSV)}}}". A Linux kernel is used on the device, however a closed-source, proprietary userland application ({{{linux_appl.exe}}}) and a closed-source, proprietary kernel module ({{{nmon.ko}}}) are responsible for providing the Home Hub's functionality.

Despite being BT-branded, it appears that several organisations (or related subsidiaries of them) have played a part in designing the hardware and software in this device. The MAC address of a typical Home Hub is reported as being within the range assigned to Thomson by Wireshark, and Alcatel and InvenTel are also mentioned in places throughout the firmware.
