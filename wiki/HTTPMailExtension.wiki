==Detecting the Presence of the HTTPMail Extensions==
According to [MS-XWDMAIL], a server is supposed to send an Allow-Extension HTTP header containing the value urn:schemas:httpmail with the output of the OPTIONS verb. 

==Potential Non-Code Intrusive Hacks/Workarounds==
Add {{{Header append Allow-Extension urn:schemas:httpmail}}} or {{{Header add Allow-Extension urn:schemas:httpmail}}} to permanently switch on the HTTPMail extension notice, at the cost of potentially violating the spec or upsetting clients.
 
==A Server Without the Extensions==
Server used: {{{Apache/2.2.11 (Fedora) DAV/2 PHP/5.2.9 mod_python/3.3.1 Python/2.5.2 mod_ssl/2.2.11 OpenSSL/0.9.8g SVN/1.5.4 mod_perl/2.0.4 Perl/v5.10.0}}} operating on TCP port 8008, serving WebDAV with SVN extensions
