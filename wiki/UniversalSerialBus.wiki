=== Wireshark ===
  * As of SVN revision 33021 of Wireshark, improvements have been made to both support of PPP-over-USB using [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1662 RFC 1662] HDLC-like framing, and "native" PPP as part of the USB Communications Device Class - meaning that higher-layer protocols such as IPv4, and PPP CHAP are now dissected (although issues still remain around fragmented packets)
  * Support for Ethernet CDC is available using the patch attached to [https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4819 Bug #4819], at a cost of breaking the dissection of other protocols encapsulated in USB_BULK URBs
  * Support for MPEG-2 Transport Stream payloads is available using the patch attached to [https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4814 Bug #4814]
  * Support for some form of ATM over USB is unimplemented
  * Support for most of the USB Mass Storage Class (and SCSI); most of the USB Hub Class; and parts of the USB Human Interface Device class has been implemented prior to that revision, for a while
