= What is QEMU? =
[http://www.qemu.org QEMU] emulates a number of hardware platforms and CPU architectures (at least x86, ARM, MIPS and PowerPC), as well as a number of other devices (e.g. Secure Digital Card readers, Bluetooth radios, Ethernet chipsets, VGA adaptors, and audio chipsets). 

= Variants and Forks =
  * [http://code.google.com/p/qemu-omap3 QEMU-OMAP3] concentrates on adding support for OMAP3 chipsets from Texas Instruments based upon the ARM architecture
  * The [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html Android Emulator] also emulates the ARM architecture and a custom chipset design (GoldFish)
  * Most of the patches necessary to run [http://www.symbian.org Symbian OS] on QEMU have been accepted upstream by the QEMU developers, and the Syborg baseport is available [http://developer.symbian.org/oss/FCL/interim/QEMU here]
  * Additional patches to support Python-based hardware devices, and the use of a host directory as a Symbian OS guest drive are hosted along with the baseport itself
