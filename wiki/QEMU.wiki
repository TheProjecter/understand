= What is QEMU? =
QEMU emulates a number of hardware platforms and CPU architectures (at least x86, ARM, MIPS and PowerPC), as well as a number of other devices (e.g. Secure Digital Card readers, Bluetooth radios, Ethernet chipsets, VGA adaptors, and audio chipsets). 

= Variants and Forks =
  * [http://code.google.com/p/qemu-omap3 QEMU-OMAP3] concentrates on adding support for OMAP3 chipsets from Texas Instruments based upon the ARM architecture
  * The [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html Android Emulator] also emulates the ARM architecture and a custom chipset design (GoldFish)
  * Although it is not available "in-the-wild", a version of QEMU supporting [http://www.symbian.org Symbian OS] (tentatively named "Syborg") supposedly exists

= Operating Systems =

  * [QNXNeutrinoOnQEMU QNX Neutrino]
  * [RISCOSOnQEMU RISC OS]
