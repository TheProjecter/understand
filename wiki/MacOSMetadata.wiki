==Mac OS X Archival Experiment==
It seems that not all metadata is archived by every archiving tool available for Mac OS X, and tools that claim to be able to archive a piece of metadata may not do so with full fidelity.

===What Does It Involve?===
  * Create a new directory that contains a set of files of UNIX-specific, special types: 
  # a FIFO/named pipe file
  # a block special file
  # a character special file
  # at least one symbolic link
  # at least one hard link
  # a socket file (or a hard link to one)
  * Create a Finder {{{Burn Folder}}}, a Finder {{{Smart Folder}}}, an {{{Alias}}}, a file with the Finder {{{Locked}}} ({{{UserImmutable}}}) attribute, a file with the Stationary Pad attribute, a File with a Finder {{{Label}}} (one of {{{Red}}}, {{{Orange}}}, {{{Yellow}}}, {{{Green}}}, {{{Blue}}}, {{{Purple}}} or {{{Grey}}}), a file with a Mac OS X-style {{{Finder Comment}}}, a file and/or directory with a custom icon, a Quarantined file

===Caveats===
  * The version of XAR (1.4) shipped with Mac OS X 10.5.x contains a [http://code.google.com/p/xar/issues/detail?id=49 bug] that causes ACLs to be stripped away when archived - although they're still present in the file system itself
  * In addition XAR 1.4 doesn't seem to care about Finder Creation timestamps, or Finder Comments (exposed as a {{{com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment}}} extended attribute)
