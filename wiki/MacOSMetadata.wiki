==Mac OS X Archival Experiment==
It seems that not all metadata is archived by every archiving tool available for Mac OS X, and tools that claim to be able to archive a piece of metadata may not do so with full fidelity.

===What Does It Involve?===
  * Create a new directory that contains a set of files of UNIX-specific, special types: 
  # a FIFO/named pipe file
  # a block special file
  # a character special file
  # at least one symbolic link
  # at least one hard link
  # a socket file (or a hard link to one)
  * Create a Finder {{{Burn Folder}}}, a Finder {{{Smart Folder}}}, an {{{Alias}}}, a file with the Finder {{{Locked}}} ({{{UserImmutable}}}) attribute, a file with the Stationary Pad attribute, a File with a Finder {{{Label}}} (one of {{{Red}}}, {{{Orange}}}, {{{Yellow}}}, {{{Green}}}, {{{Blue}}}, {{{Purple}}} or {{{Grey}}}), a file with a Mac OS X-style {{{Finder Comment}}}, a file and/or directory with a custom icon, a Quarantined file

===Caveats and Historical Issues===
Note: Some of these problems have been fixed in later versions, or have been worked around in some manner. 
 
  * The version of XAR (1.4) shipped with Mac OS X 10.5.x contains a [http://code.google.com/p/xar/issues/detail?id=49 bug] that causes ACLs to be stripped away when archived - although they're still present in the file system itself
  * In addition XAR 1.4 doesn't seem to care about Finder Creation timestamps, or Finder Comments (exposed as a {{{com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment}}} extended attribute)
  * Pax loses [http://sqrl.it/?6rdc6 BSD Flags] when archiving files, meaning that Finder Locks are also lost
  * XAR 1.5.2 seems to have problems with archiving and restoring files containing extended attributes based upon Samba NTFS Streams, thanks to an XML generation and parsing issue that has been [http://code.google.com/p/xar/issues/detail?id=70 reported] to the developers


==NTFS Streams and MS-DOS/Windows Flags on HFS+ (via Samba)==
  * When a file is created using a Windows XP (and 2000?) system, no NTFS attributes are added, and Samba pretends that the {{{Archive}}} bit is set - although this is never set on the physical host file system, and attempts to clear it are silently ignored
  * When the Windows Explorer {{{Summary}}} tab is viewed for the first time, two NTFS Streams are initialised, which correspond to the following HFS+ extended attributes:{{{:SUMMARYINFORMATION:$DATA}}} and {{{:{4C8CC155-6C1E-11D1-8E41-00C04FB9386D}:$DATA}}}
  * Running {{{xattr -l New\ Text\ Document.txt}}} reveals that the attributes contain data similar to:
{{{

  * Setting the {{{Category}}} property writes an NTFS Stream and corresponding extended attribute that looks similar to:

  * When the {{{Category}}} property is set, and no other properties are modified, the {{{:SUMMARYINFORMATION:$DATA:}}} and {{{:{4C8CC155-6C1E-11D1-8E41-00C04FB9386D}:$DATA:}}} extended attributes are unchanged from their initial state

=== Cygwin File Attributes (NTEA)===
  * When the {{{CYGWIN}}} environment variable contains {{{ntea}}}, POSIX file permissions will be stored in NTFS Streams
