==Mac OS X Archival Experiment==
It seems that not all metadata is archived by every archiving tool available for Mac OS X, and tools that claim to be able to archive a piece of metadata may not do so with full fidelity.

===What Does It Involve?===
  * Create a new directory that contains a set of files of UNIX-specific, special types: 
  # a FIFO/named pipe file
  # a block special file
  # a character special file
  # at least one symbolic link
  # at least one hard link
  # a socket file (or a hard link to one)

  * Create a number of Mac OS X-specific objects, including: 
  # a Finder {{{Burn Folder}}}
  # a Finder {{{Smart Folder}}}
  # an {{{Alias}}}
  # a file with the Finder {{{Locked}}} ({{{UserImmutable}}}) attribute
  # a file with the {{{Stationary Pad}}} attribute
  # a File with a Finder {{{Label}}} (one of {{{Red}}}, {{{Orange}}}, {{{Yellow}}}, {{{Green}}}, {{{Blue}}}, {{{Purple}}} or {{{Grey}}})
  # a file with a Mac OS X-style {{{Finder Comment}}}
  # a file and/or directory with a custom icon
  # a Quarantined file

===Caveats and Historical Issues===
Note: Some of these problems have been fixed in later versions, or have been worked around in some manner. 

  * Pax and GNU TAR 1.16.1 lose [http://sqrl.it/?6rdc6 BSD Flags] when archiving files, meaning that Finder Locks are also lost
  * Pax and GNU TAR 1.16.1 refuse to archive socket files, as does STAR 1.5.1
  * STAR 1.5.1, when compiled on Mac OS X seems to choke on ACLs, and seemingly ignores all extended attributes, even when compiled with the necessary options 
  * The version of XAR (1.4) shipped with Mac OS X 10.5.x contains a [http://code.google.com/p/xar/issues/detail?id=49 bug] that causes ACLs to be stripped away when archived - although they're still present in the file system itself
  * In addition XAR 1.4 doesn't seem to care about Finder Creation timestamps, or Finder Comments (exposed as a {{{com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment}}} extended attribute)
  * XAR 1.5.2 seems to have problems with archiving and restoring files containing extended attributes based upon Samba NTFS Streams, thanks to an XML generation and parsing issue that has been [http://code.google.com/p/xar/issues/detail?id=70 reported] to the developers

==Mac OS (X) File Type and Creator Codes==
===Brief History===
  * These have been prevalent as a means of identifying files according to the application that generated them, and the type of data that they held, since the earliest versions of the Mac OS
  * In most versions of the Mac OS, up to and including Mac OS 9.x, type/creator mappings and cached icons were held within {{{Desktop DB}}} and {{{Desktop DF}}} files stored in the root directory of a HFS or HFS+ volume
  * These database files are also used by a small number of older Carbon-based applications on Mac OS X

===Implementation===
  * In Mac OS X, these are exposed in pseudo-extended attributes that look like this:
{{{
com.apple.FinderInfo:
0000   57 58 42 4E 4D 53 57 44 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00    WXBNMSWD........
0010   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00    ................

}}}
  * The file type code (e.g. {{{WXBN}}}) is always stored prior to the creator code (e.g. {{{MSWD}}}) for efficiency 
  * Which really looks like this, according to {{{hfsdebug-lite}}}:
{{{
  # Finder Info
  fdType               = 0x5758424e (WXBN)
  fdCreator            = 0x4d535744 (MSWD)
  fdFlags              = 0000000000000000
  fdLocation           = (v = 0, h = 0)
  opaque               = 0

}}}

==NTFS Streams and MS-DOS/Windows Flags on HFS+ (via Samba)==
  * When a file is created using a Windows XP (and 2000?) system, no NTFS attributes are added, and Samba pretends that the {{{Archive}}} bit is set - although this is never set on the physical host file system, and attempts to clear it are silently ignored
  * When the Windows Explorer {{{Summary}}} tab is viewed for the first time, two NTFS Streams are initialised, which correspond to the following HFS+ extended attributes:{{{:SUMMARYINFORMATION:$DATA}}} and {{{:{4C8CC155-6C1E-11D1-8E41-00C04FB9386D}:$DATA}}}
  * Running {{{xattr -l New\ Text\ Document.txt}}} reveals that the attributes contain data similar to:
{{{
:SUMMARYINFORMATION:$DATA:
0000   FE FF 00 00 05 01 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00    ................

}}}
  * Setting the {{{Category}}} property writes an NTFS Stream and corresponding extended attribute that looks similar to:
{{{
:DOCUMENTSUMMARYINFORMATION:$DATA:

}}}
  * When the {{{Category}}} property is set, and no other properties are modified, the {{{:SUMMARYINFORMATION:$DATA:}}} and {{{:{4C8CC155-6C1E-11D1-8E41-00C04FB9386D}:$DATA:}}} extended attributes are unchanged from their initial state

=== Samba Metadata Options ===
  * The manpage for {{{smb.conf}}} mentions some interesting configuration options that relate to metadata:
  # {{{dos filemode =}}} {{{no}}}/{{{yes}}}
  # {{{dos filetime resolution =}}} {{{no}}}/{{{yes}}}
  # {{{dos filetimes =}}} {{{yes}}}/{{{no}}}
  # {{{ea support =}}} {{{no}}}/{{{yes}}}
  * The default options are listed in order of potential values, sorted by the default
  * The version that ships with Mac OS X contains even more potential options that aren't mentioned in the manpage

=== Cygwin File Attributes (NTEA)===
  * When the {{{CYGWIN}}} environment variable contains {{{ntea}}}, POSIX file permissions will be stored in NTFS Streams
  * For example, setting a file's permissions to {{{777}}} results in something similar to:
{{{

user..UNIXATTR:
0000   FF 01 00 00                                        ....

}}}

==Mac OS X 10.5 Finder/Spotlight Comments==
  * Exposed in a pseudo-extended attribute that looks like this:
{{{
com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment:
0000   62 70 6C 69 73 74 30 30 5F 10 11 53 70 6F 74 6C    bplist00_..Spotl

0030   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 1C             .............

}}}
  * It seems that no additional extended attributes are created, although some presumably exist
  * We can extract this, scrub out the ASCII textual representation and line numbers, paste that result into a hex editor, and produce a file of type {{{Apple binary property list}}}
  * Using {{{plutil -convert xml1}}} on this file, we can attempt to create an XML representation of the comment that looks like this:
{{{
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<string>Spotlight Comment</string>
</plist>

}}}

===Experiment, Part 1===
  * It may possible to add a Finder comment to a new file by editing the string in the XML that was produced earlier, and converting it back into a binary property list file, like this:
  * Create a plain-text {{{CustomComment.plist}}} file containing this content:
{{{
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<string>Hand-crafted Comment</string>
</plist>
}}}
 * Check the validity of the XML file using {{{plutil -lint CustomComment.plist}}}
 * Convert it into a binary {{{plist}}} using {{{plutil -convert binary1 CustomLabel.plist}}}
 * Use {{{touch}}} to create a new, empty file named {{{NoComment}}}
 * Attempt to apply the new "comment" to {{{NoComment}}} using {{{xattr -w "com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment" `cat CustomComment.plist` NoComment}}}
 * Notice that the Finder Comment hasn't changed, since the conversion processes are seemingly lossy (need to investigate)

===Experiment, Part 2===
  * Using a hex editor, and the raw binary {{{plist}}} dump that was created earlier, we can attempt to modify the comment string directly, using a hex editor
  * Unfortunately, this doesn't produce a useful result when the {{{plutil -lint}}} function is used:
{{{
HexedComment.plist:
XML parser error:
	Unexpected character b at line 1
Old-style plist parser error:
	Unexpected ';' or '=' after key at line 1
}}}
  * Still, we can attempt to inject the new {{{plist}}} into the necessary extended attribute, like so: {{{xattr -w "com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment" `cat HexedComment.plist` NoComment}}}
  * However, it seems that we hit a limitation as far as injecting binary data with {{{cat}}} goes, so that the attribute data gets mangled at write time
  * In addition, it seems that the shell is also attempting to execute the data inside the {{{plist}}} file, and failing with: {{{No such file: Comment}}}
  * {{{xattr -l}}} reveals that said data has been mangled:  {{{com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment: bplist00_Fake}}}
  * A similar result also occurs when attempting to inject a {{{.ZIP}}} archive: {{{JunkData: PK}}}

==Mac OS X Finder Colour Labels==
===Red===
  * Exposed by a pseudo-extended attribute that looks like:
{{{
com.apple.FinderInfo:
0000   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0C 00 00 00 00 00 00    ................

}}}
  * Really looks like this, according to {{{hfsdebug-lite}}}:
{{{
  # Finder Info
  fdType               = 0
  fdCreator            = 0
  fdFlags              = 0000000000001100

  fdLocation           = (v = 0, h = 0)
  opaque               = 0
}}}

===Orange===

  fdFlags              = 0000000000001110
                       . Color label = orange
  fdLocation           = (v = 0, h = 0)
  opaque               = 0
}}} 

===Yellow===
  * Exposed by a pseudo-extended attribute that looks like:
{{{

  fdLocation           = (v = 0, h = 0)

}}}

===Green===
  * Exposed by a pseudo-extended attribute that looks like:
{{{

  fdLocation           = (v = 0, h = 0)
  opaque               = 0
}}}

==Internet-Originated Files Metadata==
===Quarantined Files===
  * The Quarantine status is controlled by the {{{com.apple.quarantine}}} extended attribute
  * Typically, the Quarantine data consists of a set of 4 semicolon-delimited values (a set of decimal digits of an unknown purpose - typically {{{0000}}}, an 8 character opaque ID, the name of the application that created the Quarantined file, and the application's UTI (Uniform Type Identifier) prefixed with a pipe symbol)
  * For example, for two different files downloaded using Mozilla FireFox, this looks like:
{{{
com.apple.quarantine: 0000;4b392bb2;Firefox;|org.mozilla.firefox
com.apple.quarantine: 0000;4b38d820;Firefox;|org.mozilla.firefox
}}}
  * For a [http://images.apple.com/startpage/images/2009/09/promo-touch-20090909.jpg JPEG file] downloaded by Safari, this looks like: {{{com.apple.quarantine: 0000;4b3a3be6;Safari;|com.apple.Safari}}}

===Opaque Quarantine IDs===
NOTE: This information may not be accurate, and is currently considered to be of draft quality.

  * It is not known if the first 3 characters of the ID vary between Mac OS X installations, applications/application types, or hardware configurations
  * For most files that the author has seen, these characters have been {{{4b3}}}, although it is not guaranteed that this will always be the case
  * It may be the case that these IDs are based upon date and time (including seconds, and smaller units of time measurement), application PID, UNIX UID number, or some other data source - although it is likely that they are also derived from the content of the file itself
  * In the of the JPEG file mentioned earlier, it seems that at least the first 5 characters ({{{4b3a4}}}) remain static when multiple copies are made by dragging the object out of the Safari window into the {{{Desktop}}} directory
  * A rough pattern emerges, in this case (only the last 3 characters change):
{{{
com.apple.quarantine: 0000;4b3a40d0;Safari;|com.apple.Safari
com.apple.quarantine: 0000;4b3a4107;Safari;|com.apple.Safari
}}}

===Safari File Origin Info=== 
  * For downloaded files, Safari creates an extended attribute named {{{com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms}}} containing a binary property list, with the source URL for reference
  * This metadata is shown to the user in the Finder's {{{Get Info}}} dialogue box, and is also collected for use by Spotlight
  * For example, for a Web Archive containing the content of [http://www.apple.com/startpage Apple's StartPage], this looks like:
{{{
com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms:
0000   62 70 6C 69 73 74 30 30 A1 01 5F 10 1F 68 74 74    bplist00.._..htt

  * {{{plutil -convert xml1}}} will decompose this into XML that looks like:
{{{
