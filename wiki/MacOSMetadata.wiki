==Mac OS X Archival Experiment==
It seems that not all metadata is archived by every archiving tool available for Mac OS X, and tools that claim to be able to archive a piece of metadata may not do so with full fidelity.

===What Does It Involve?===
  * Create a new directory that contains a set of files of UNIX-specific, special types: 
  # a FIFO/named pipe file
  # a block special file
  # a character special file
  # at least one symbolic link
  # at least one hard link
  # a socket file (or a hard link to one)

  * Create a number of Mac OS X-specific objects, including: 
  # a Finder {{{Burn Folder}}}
  # a Finder {{{Smart Folder}}}
  # an {{{Alias}}}
  # a file with the Finder {{{Locked}}} ({{{UserImmutable}}}) attribute
  # a file with the {{{Stationary Pad}}} attribute
  # a File with a Finder {{{Label}}} (one of {{{Red}}}, {{{Orange}}}, {{{Yellow}}}, {{{Green}}}, {{{Blue}}}, {{{Purple}}} or {{{Grey}}})
  # a file with a Mac OS X-style {{{Finder Comment}}}
  # a file and/or directory with a custom icon
  # a Quarantined file

===Caveats and Historical Issues===
Note: Some of these problems have been fixed in later versions, or have been worked around in some manner. 
 
  * The version of XAR (1.4) shipped with Mac OS X 10.5.x contains a [http://code.google.com/p/xar/issues/detail?id=49 bug] that causes ACLs to be stripped away when archived - although they're still present in the file system itself
  * In addition XAR 1.4 doesn't seem to care about Finder Creation timestamps, or Finder Comments (exposed as a {{{com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment}}} extended attribute)
  * Pax and TAR lose [http://sqrl.it/?6rdc6 BSD Flags] when archiving files, meaning that Finder Locks are also lost
  * XAR 1.5.2 seems to have problems with archiving and restoring files containing extended attributes based upon Samba NTFS Streams, thanks to an XML generation and parsing issue that has been [http://code.google.com/p/xar/issues/detail?id=70 reported] to the developers


==NTFS Streams and MS-DOS/Windows Flags on HFS+ (via Samba)==
  * When a file is created using a Windows XP (and 2000?) system, no NTFS attributes are added, and Samba pretends that the {{{Archive}}} bit is set - although this is never set on the physical host file system, and attempts to clear it are silently ignored
  * When the Windows Explorer {{{Summary}}} tab is viewed for the first time, two NTFS Streams are initialised, which correspond to the following HFS+ extended attributes:{{{:SUMMARYINFORMATION:$DATA}}} and {{{:{4C8CC155-6C1E-11D1-8E41-00C04FB9386D}:$DATA}}}
  * Running {{{xattr -l New\ Text\ Document.txt}}} reveals that the attributes contain data similar to:
{{{
:SUMMARYINFORMATION:$DATA:

}}}
  * Setting the {{{Category}}} property writes an NTFS Stream and corresponding extended attribute that looks similar to:
{{{

}}}
  * When the {{{Category}}} property is set, and no other properties are modified, the {{{:SUMMARYINFORMATION:$DATA:}}} and {{{:{4C8CC155-6C1E-11D1-8E41-00C04FB9386D}:$DATA:}}} extended attributes are unchanged from their initial state

=== Samba Metadata Options ===
  * The manpage for {{{smb.conf}}} mentions some interesting configuration options that relate to metadata:
  # {{{dos filemode =}}} {{{no}}}/{{{yes}}}
  # {{{dos filetime resolution =}}} {{{no}}}/{{{yes}}}
  # {{{dos filetimes =}}} {{{yes}}}/{{{no}}}
  # {{{ea support =}}} {{{no}}}/{{{yes}}}
  * The default options are listed in order of potential values, sorted by the default
  * The version that ships with Mac OS X contains even more potential options that aren't mentioned in the manpage

=== Cygwin File Attributes (NTEA)===
  * When the {{{CYGWIN}}} environment variable contains {{{ntea}}}, POSIX file permissions will be stored in NTFS Streams
  * For example, setting a file's permissions to {{{777}}} results in something similar to:
{{{

user..UNIXATTR:
0000   FF 01 00 00                                        ....

}}}

==Mac OS X 10.5 Finder/Spotlight Comments==
  * Exposed in a pseudo-extended attribute that looks like this:
{{{
com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment:
0000   62 70 6C 69 73 74 30 30 5F 10 11 53 70 6F 74 6C    bplist00_..Spotl

0030   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 1C             .............

}}}
  * It seems that no additional extended attributes are created, although some presumably exist
  * We can extract this, scrub out the ASCII textual representation and line numbers, paste that result into a hex editor, and produce a file of type {{{Apple binary property list}}}
  * Using {{{plutil -convert xml1}}} on this file, we can attempt to create an XML representation of the comment that looks like this:
{{{
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<string>Spotlight Comment</string>
</plist>

}}}

===Experiment, Part 1===
  * It may possible to add a Finder comment to a new file by editing the string in the XML that was produced earlier, and converting it back into a binary property list file, like this:
  * Create a plain-text {{{CustomComment.plist}}} file containing this content:
{{{
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<string>Hand-crafted Comment</string>
</plist>
}}}
 * Check the validity of the XML file using {{{plutil -lint CustomComment.plist}}}
 * Convert it into a binary {{{plist}}} using {{{plutil -convert binary1 CustomLabel.plist}}}
 * Use {{{touch}}} to create a new, empty file named {{{NoComment}}}
 * Attempt to apply the new "comment" to {{{NoComment}}} using {{{xattr -w "com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment" `cat CustomComment.plist` NoComment}}}
 * Notice that the Finder Comment hasn't changed, since the conversion processes are seemingly lossy (need to investigate)

===Experiment, Part 2===
  * Using a hex editor, and the raw binary {{{plist}}} dump that was created earlier, we can attempt to modify the comment string directly, using a hex editor
  * Unfortunately, this doesn't produce a useful result when the {{{plutil -lint}}} function is used:
{{{
HexedComment.plist:
XML parser error:
	Unexpected character b at line 1
Old-style plist parser error:
	Unexpected ';' or '=' after key at line 1
}}}
  * Still, we can attempt to inject the new {{{plist}}} into the necessary extended attribute, like so: {{{xattr -w "com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment" `cat HexedComment.plist` NoComment}}}
  * However, it seems that we hit a limitation as far as injecting binary data with {{{cat}}} goes, so that the attribute data gets mangled at write time
  * In addition, it seems that the shell is also attempting to execute the data inside the {{{plist}}} file, and failing with: {{{No such file: Comment}}}
  * {{{xattr -l}}} reveals that said data has been mangled:  {{{com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment: bplist00_Fake}}}
  * A similar result also occurs when attempting to inject a {{{.ZIP}}} archive: {{{JunkData: PK}}}

==Mac OS X Finder Colour Labels==
===Red===
  * Exposed by a pseudo-extended attribute that looks like:
{{{
com.apple.FinderInfo:
0000   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0C 00 00 00 00 00 00    ................

}}}
  * Really looks like this, according to {{{hfsdebug-lite}}}:
{{{
  # Finder Info
  fdType               = 0
  fdCreator            = 0
  fdFlags              = 0000000000001100
                       . Color label = red
  fdLocation           = (v = 0, h = 0)

                       . Color label = orange
  fdLocation           = (v = 0, h = 0)
  opaque               = 0
}}} 

===Yellow===
  * Exposed by a pseudo-extended attribute that looks like:
{{{
com.apple.FinderInfo:

  fdLocation           = (v = 0, h = 0)
  opaque               = 0
}}}

==Internet-Originated Files Metadata==
===Quarantined Files===
  * The Quarantine status is controlled by the {{{com.apple.quarantine}}} extended attribute
  * Typically, the Quarantine data consists of a set of 4 semicolon-delimited values (a set of decimal digits of an unknown purpose - typically {{{0000}}}, a checksum of an indeterminate type, the name of the application that created the Quarantined file, and the application's UTI (Uniform Type Identifier) prefixed with a pipe symbol)
  * For example, for two different files downloaded using Mozilla FireFox, this looks like:
{{{
com.apple.quarantine: 0000;4b392bb2;Firefox;|org.mozilla.firefox
com.apple.quarantine: 0000;4b38d820;Firefox;|org.mozilla.firefox
}}}

===Safari {{{.WebArchive}}} Origin Info=== 
  * For at least Web Archive files, Safari creates an extended attribute named {{{com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms}}} containing a binary property list, with the source URL for reference
  * This metadata is shown to the user in the Finder's {{{Get Info}}} dialogue box, and is also collected for use by Spotlight
  * For example, for a Web Archive containing the content of [http://www.apple.com/startpage Apple's StartPage], this looks like:
{{{
com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms:
0000   62 70 6C 69 73 74 30 30 A1 01 5F 10 1F 68 74 74    bplist00.._..htt

0040   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 2C          .............,
}}}
  * {{{plutil -convert xml1}}} will decompose this into XML that looks like:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
