= ISO/IEC 7816 Contact Cards =

== Software ==
  * The [http://www.opensc-project.org/opensc OpenSC project] supply a number of tools for working with contact smartcards under Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (plus other UNIX-esque operating systems). 

== Other Information ==
  * A [http://doc.utwente.nl/55705/1/dsse-tr-95-5.pdf paper] on the subject of smartcards and smartcard operating systems was published in 1995 by Pieter H. Hartel, and Eduard K. de Jong Frz at the 
University of Southampton's Department of Electronics and Computer Science.

== Software ==

  * An Open Source implementation of an NFC stack, and various related utilities is available from the [http://www.libnfc.org/documentation/introduction LibNFC] project.

  * The author of this page has released a number of small utilities, and enhancements to third-party ones in a [https://bitbucket.org/vmlemon/smartcardtools repository] on BitBucket.

  * A link to a tool for examining data stored on Atmel CryptoRF tokens, and errata is available in [http://www.libnfc.org/community/topic/235/solved-info-about-nfccryptorf/ this forum post].

== Datasheets ==

  * A [http://idtronic-smarttags.com/pdfs/cards/STM%20SRI512.pdf datasheet] is available for the STMicroElectronics SRI512 ISO/IEC 14443-B chipset.

  * A [http://www.acs.com.hk/drivers/eng/TDS_TOPAZ.pdf datasheet] is available from ACS for the InnoVision/Broadcom Topaz family of ISO/IEC 14443-A chipsets. 

  * A [http://datasheets.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/MAX66040.pdf redacted datasheet] is available for the Maxim MAX66040 ISO/IEC 14443-B chipset.

=== NXP !MiFare Classic 4KB ===

  * LibNFC's {{{nfc-list -v}}} command reports:

* Not compliant with ISO/IEC 18092

}}}

  * Using the [http://code.google.com/p/nfc-tools/wiki/mfoc MFOC utility] under Linux, it is possible to derive the sector keys for a genuine MiFare Classic card, whilst dumping and decrypting its entire contents in a reasonable timeframe (several minutes) on a moderately powerful PC. <br/> It appears that this tool does not work properly under VirtualBox, due to latency induced by its USB passthrough implementation.

=== NXP !MiFare DESFire EV1 ===

=== ISO/IEC 14443-B tokens ===

  * [http://code.google.com/p/libnfc/issues/detail?id=168 Issue #168] on the LibNFC project's issues list contains some details pertinent to the proprietary "14443-B'" technology used by some Calypso transport cards.

=== Maxim MAX66040E-000AA+ ===

  * LibNFC's {{{nfc-list -v}}} command reports:

{{{

  * These cards are advertised as having a 64-bit UID, consisting of data in the {{{PUPI}}} field (e.g. {{{a2  a6  02  00}}} or {{{34  ab  02  00}}}), and data in the {{{Application Data}}} field (e.g. {{{77  21  71}}}).

  * The {{{Application Data}}} field supposedly contains the "upper 32 bits of the UID" (which appears to be consistent between new cards); and the (variable) PUPI corresponds to the "lower 32 bits of the UID".

== Hardware Suppliers ==

  * Atmel of the USA have a [http://www.atmel.com/forms/Samples.asp?category_id=172&family_id=671&source=getting_started product sampling programme]. <br/> Although the order process appears to be successful (since I receive an e-mail in my university account), I have had limited success with using the confirmation URL provided in said e-mail.

  * [http://trac.switch-science.com/wiki/FeliCa-international-order Switch Science] of Japan appear to be supplying Sony FeliCa (RC-S701) tags on an international basis - although the author cannot vouch for the company's service, due to having never utilised it.

  * The Identive Group of the USA appear to be supplying [http://www.identivenfc.com/google-nfc-tags/google-nfc-tags-type1.htm Topaz 512-byte tags] on an international basis - although the author cannot vouch for the company's service, due to having never utilised it.

  * Maxim supply a number of RFID-related products through a [https://shop.maxim-ic.com/storefront/searchsample.do?event=Sample&menuitem=Sample free sampling programme] - although shipments are slightly delayed due to requiring internal Business Manager authorisation; and a commercial or academic e-mail address is required for successful order approval. <br/> Samples ordered within the UK are usually despatched from a UK-based warehouse, if memory serves correctly.

  * The [http://wiki.yobi.be/wiki/ YobiWiki] has a fairly exhaustive [http://wiki.yobi.be/wiki/RFID page] on Radio Frequency Identification-related content.
