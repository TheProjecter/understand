== Software ==

  * An Open Source implementation of an NFC stack, and various related utilities is available from the [http://www.libnfc.org/documentation/introduction LibNFC] project.

  * The author of this page has released a number of small utilities, and enhancements to third-party ones in a [https://bitbucket.org/vmlemon/smartcardtools repository] on BitBucket.

== Datasheets ==

  * A [http://idtronic-smarttags.com/pdfs/cards/STM%20SRI512.pdf datasheet] is available for the STMicroElectronics SRI512 ISO/IEC 14443-B chipset.

  * A [http://www.acs.com.hk/drivers/eng/TDS_TOPAZ.pdf datasheet] is available from ACS for the InnoVision/Broadcom Topaz family of ISO/IEC 14443-A chipsets. 

  * A [http://datasheets.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/MAX66040.pdf redacted datasheet] is available for the Maxim MAX66040 ISO/IEC 14443-B chipset.

== Hardware Suppliers ==

  * [http://trac.switch-science.com/wiki/FeliCa-international-order Switch Science] of Japan appear to be supplying Sony FeliCa (RC-S701) tags on an international basis - although the author cannot vouch for the company's service, due to having never utilised it.

  * The Identive Group of the USA appear to be supplying [http://www.identivenfc.com/google-nfc-tags/google-nfc-tags-type1.htm Topaz 512-byte tags] on an international basis - although the author cannot vouch for the company's service, due to having never utilised it.

  * Maxim supply a number of RFID-related products through a [https://shop.maxim-ic.com/storefront/searchsample.do?event=Sample&menuitem=Sample free sampling programme] - although shipments are slightly delayed due to requiring internal Business Manager authorisation; and a commercial or academic e-mail address is required for successful order approval. <br/> Samples ordered within the UK are usually dispatched from a UK-based warehouse, if memory serves correctly.
