== Software ==

  * An Open Source implementation of an NFC stack, and various related utilities is available from the [http://www.libnfc.org/documentation/introduction LibNFC] project.

  * The author of this page has released a number of small utilities, and enhancements to third-party ones in a [https://bitbucket.org/vmlemon/smartcardtools repository] on BitBucket.

== Datasheets ==

  * A [http://idtronic-smarttags.com/pdfs/cards/STM%20SRI512.pdf datasheet] is available for the STMicroElectronics SRI512 ISO/IEC 14443-B chipset.

  * A [http://www.acs.com.hk/drivers/eng/TDS_TOPAZ.pdf datasheet] is available from ACS for the InnoVision/Broadcom Topaz family of ISO/IEC 14443-A chipsets.

== Hardware Suppliers ==

  * [http://trac.switch-science.com/wiki/FeliCa-international-order Switch Science] of Japan appear to be supplying Sony FeliCa (RC-S701) tags on an international basis - although the author cannot vouch for the company's service, due to having never utilised it. 

  * The Identive Group of the USA appear to be supplying [http://www.identivenfc.com/google-nfc-tags/google-nfc-tags-type1.htm Topaz 512-byte tags] on an international basis - although the author cannot vouch for the company's service, due to having never utilised it.

== Other Information == 

 * The [http://wiki.yobi.be/wiki/ YobiWiki] has a fairly exhaustive [http://wiki.yobi.be/wiki/RFID page] on Radio Frequency Identification-related content.
