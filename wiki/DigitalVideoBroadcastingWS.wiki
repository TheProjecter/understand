#summary Content related to the Digital Video Broadcasting standards, and dissection thereof using Wireshark

=Patches=
  * The patch attached to [https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4814 Bug #4814] will enable support for dissecting MPEG-2 Transport Streams encapsulated in USB framing that are either being captured from a live USB capture session (only supported under Linux), or stored in a trace file on-disk - it has not yet been committed, so there are no SVN builds for Windows
  * A patch attached to [https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4178 Bug #4178] claims to support dissection of DVB IP datacasts, under certain conditions

=Somewhat Related Stuff=
  * Support for dissection of DOCSIS frames encapsulated within MPEG-2 Transport Streams has been implemented for a while, so it seems - a sample of these might be attached to [https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3218 Bug #3218]
