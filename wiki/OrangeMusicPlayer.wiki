== Introduction ==

Orange Music Player is currently available for download [http://orange.kozmusic.com/ here], and versions for several platforms exist (Symbian OS/S60 (ARM - S60v2, S60v3 and UIQ), Windows Mobile (ARM), and a [http://orange.kozmusic.com/installs/j2me/65582/JukeBox.jad Java version] intended primarily for Motorola phones). 

In theory, the S60v3 version may work on S60v5/[http://blog.symbian.org/2009/04/30/reviewing-the-release-plan/ Symbian^2]-based devices, as they are also based upon Symbian OS 9.x versions, and share substantial amounts of source code and infrastructure.

== Symbian OS/S60v2 version ==

It is possible to install this version on either a handset's internal Flash memory, or on an external Flash memory card (e.g. RS-MMC or MicroSD), a number of directories and files are installed or otherwise created, and a number of files are also downloaded from an undetermined HTTP server.
