==Additional Sources of Packet Captures==
  * A number of BACnet packet captures are available [http://kargs.net/captures/ here]
  * The [http://pcapr.net pcapr.net] service provides an open-access capture file repository, facilities for uploading new files and a number of other tools
  * The [http://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures Sample Captures] page on the [http://wiki.wireshark.org Wireshark Wiki] is a useful source of protocol capture files
  * A trove of obscure, unique, old, and new capture files that have been used in the development and testing of [http://www.wireshark.org Wireshark] is available in the form of the [http://www.wireshark.org/lists/ Wireshark Mailing Lists]
  * Even more sample files are available on the old [http://www.ethereal.com/lists/ Ethereal Mailing Lists], although they may disappear in the future - archiving those files here, or on the new Wireshark Wiki might be a good idea
  * The [https://bugs.wireshark.org Wireshark Bugzilla] instance is also another good source of capture files 
  * [http://packetlife.net/captures/ Packet Life] have various user-submitted capture files, as well as forums and a number of other resources
  * The page [http://aa-security.de/dumps/ here] has some capture files of historical interest (containing 3Com XNS, Token Ring, NetBIOS, IPX, ISDN and FDDI packets, amongst others)
  * [http://www.thetechfirm.com/packets/index.html This page] has samples of various protocols, and notes on differences between analyser dissector implementations
  * An annotated trace of an iTunes 7 DAAP session is available, [http://www.webpages.ttu.edu/mroth/tunes/login.htm here]
  * A capture file containing SocketCAN frames is [https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4299 here]
  * The page [http://jon.oberheide.org/uverse/ here] has some AT&T U-Verse packet captures
  * Microsoft have released a number of capture files, to accompany their "open" documentation [here http://sysdoccap.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=System%20Overview%20Document%20Scenario%20Captures]

==Specification Documents and Useful Information==
  * Internet Drafts from the [http://www.ietf.org Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)] are available [http://www.ietf.org/ID.html here]
  * Requests For Comments (RFC) documents from the IETF are available [http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html here]
  * The [http://www.osta.org Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA)] Universal Disk Format (UDF) specifications are available [http://osta.org/specs/index.htm here]

  * A copy of the [http://banyan.bamertal.com/Banyan-supplier-help/ProtoDef/ProtoDefMain.htm VINES Protocol Definition] is available 
  * A header file containing a list of libpcap/tcpdump DLT values is available [http://fxr.watson.org/fxr/source/net/bpf.h here] (although it may not be up-to-date)
  * [http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2006/01/freebsd-networking-over-firewire-you.html This blog post] contains a {{{tshark}}} text dump of an Apple IP-over-1394 packet that can be converted to a usable packet capture file with {{{text2pcap -l 138 }}}after saving it to a file
  * The Unified EFI (UEFI) 2.3 specifications, which include additional information on the GUID Partition Table (GPT) in chapter 5 are available [http://www.uefi.org/specs/ here], after registration

==Protocol Stack Implementations==
  * An implementation of Media-Oriented Systems Transport (MoST) for Linux is available, [http://most4linux.sourceforge.net/ here]
  * Microsoft's raw NetBIOS implementation from Windows XP is available, [http://www.mac-net.com/174984.page here]
  * LANtastic 8.01 (works as a 45 day trial, without a license) is available, [http://pcmicro.com/lantastic here]
  * An implementation of AX.25 and a number of other amateur radio-related protocols, as well as links to protocol documentation is available, [http://www.linux-ax25.org here]

==Tools==
  * [http://www.wireshark.org Wireshark] is probably the best (Open Source) protocol analyser and network monitor - no introduction is really necessary
  * Until someone can add support for capturing on the Windows loopback interface to LibPCap, a 30 day trial of [http://www.tamos.com/products/commview/ TamoSoft CommView] is probably the best bet - it saves files in a number of formats (including the LibPCap format, and a proprietary format that supports multiple link types which is also supported by Wireshark)

==File System Implementations==
  * An implementation of several variants of the UCSD Pascal/P-System file system is available [http://ucsd-psystem-fs.sourceforge.net/ here]
