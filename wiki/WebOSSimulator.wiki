#summary Exploring and hacking Palm's x86-based simulator build of WebOS

==Getting CaDAVer Running==
The "easiest" (subjective) way to run CaDAVer is to copy the {{{/usr/bin/cadaver}}} executable, and the listed to a directory available to a local HTTP server (e.g. Apache), and then use BusyBox's internal {{{wget}}} command under {{{novaterm}}} to download them.

Within the WebOS VirtualBox virtual machine, the host system's IPv4 address is {{{10.0.2.2}}}, and the guest's is {{{10.0.2.15}}}, although traffic intended for the host only, masquerades as traffic from {{{127.0.0.1}}} and is visible on the loopback interface.

===Dependencies===
As copied from a Fedora 10 installation, the following shared libraries are required (these must be placed in /lib on the simulator), in order to get CaDAVer to function:

 * libreadline.so.5
 * libneon.so.27 
 * libtinfo.so.5
 * libgnutls.so.26 
 * libpakchois.so.0
