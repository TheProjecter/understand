=== Embedded HTTP Server ===

  * Seems to implement only HTTP/1.0, and returns the header "{{{Server:HTTP/1.0\r\n}}}" in its responses to requests

  * Serves a number of Java class files from a virtual root directory, and from the {{{/wjjava/snmp/}}} directory, including:

   * {{{SNMPBinding.class}}}
   * {{{MsgBox.class}}}
   * {{{Home.class}}}

Judging from a brief overview of a network trace file that I created whilst configuring the server, strings included in these classes include references to "{{{Venice}}}", copyright statements, SCM usernames, ASN.1, and IPX - although I have not taken the time to manually download/extract, and decompile these.  

=== Telnet Interface ===
  * A basic Telnet session involving connecting to the server, retrieving help information, and then dumping the device configuration:
{{{
telnet 192.168.1.69
Trying 192.168.1.69...
Connected to 192.168.1.69.

== Internal Hardware ==

  * Access to the motherboard is provided after removing two Torx screws, located on the bottom of the device. I found that the thicker blade of a pair of large, cheap hairdressing scissors was capable of undoing them - but use of a Torx screwdriver is recommended...

=== Motherboard (Front) ===

=== Intel 802.3/Ethernet Media Access Controller/AUI Chip ===
  * A datasheet for the [http://www.digchip.com/datasheets/parts/datasheet/227/LXT908PC.php LXT908PC] Ethernet MAC chip is available. 

=== Pulse PE-68041 Isolation Transformer Chip === 

  * A datasheet for the [http://www.datasheetarchive.com/dlmain/Datasheets-8/DSA-151194.pdf PE-68041] isolation transformer by Pulse Engineering is available.

=== Motorola LM317D2T Voltage/Thermal(?) Regulator Chip ===

  * A series of [http://www.datasheetcatalog.com/datasheets_pdf/L/M/3/1/LM317D2T.shtml datasheets] for what seem to be third-party clones of the LM317D2T chip are available. I do not know which corresponds precisely to the chip on the motherboard.

=== Agilent 1QM7-0003 Chip ===
  * I have not yet been able to determine the purpose of this (SoC?) chip, although it seems that a few companies may distribute it.

=== Oki/OkiData MS4V16258B-45J Chip ===
  * Have been unable to find a datasheet, or supplier information - but I suspect that this be a co-processor implementing support for a page definition language, or a memory chip, given the presence of another OkiData chip.
   * This chip was probably custom-designed for this product.

=== Oki/OkiData 1818-8754 Chip === 
   * Marked with "(C) 00 HP - iIPS R27V1602E-56 1392BA1". Purpose unknown; maybe custom-designed.

== Supported Protocols ==
  * IPv4 
  * Novell IPX
  * SNMP via Java-based configuration utility
  * HTTP
