  * There are a vast number of client and server implementations of it available (too many to sanely list here), including the clients listed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients here], a number of non-human-clients ("robots"), and preconfigured IRC networks and services (e.g. [http://www.freenode.org FreeNode])
  * Additional information is available at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat Wikipedia]
