## Understand, in a Nutshell ##
The Understand project aims to document a number of file formats/file systems, protocols and methods of integrating software, to provide and coordinate otherwise missing documentation.

## <font color='red'>New!</font> Understand Next ##
[Understand Next](https://sites.google.com/site/understandnext/home) is like Understand, but is now hosted on Google Sites, which should remedy some potential issues surrounding downloads hosting; and limits on "wiki" page content sizes that caused problems when trying to include large volumes of screen dumps in pages...

## Just what is this thing, anyway? ##
  * It's a place where folks can easily find and share "live" examples of file formats, file systems, and network protocols
  * Somewhere to fill in the missing pieces, when it comes to documenting the integration of disparate pieces of software, or knowledge of various bits of data

## What isn't Understand? ##
  * A flying toy (to quote Toy Story)
  * A replacement for every other knowledgebase or publicly available specification on the planet
  * A replacement for the (rather nifty) service at [pcapr.net](http://pcapr.net), or the Wireshark Wiki
  * Google or WolframAlpha (seriously ;))

## Sounds great, how can I help? ##
By virtue of being a project on Google Code, commit/modification access is limited to people who have e-mail addresses connected to the project. This also ensures that we don't get wiki/content spam, as a nice side-effect.

If you want commit access, please send an e-mail to `tyson DOT key AT gmail DOT com`, containing the phrase "Wiki Commit Access" in the Subject. You can also ask in the [FreeNode](http://www.freenode.org) (IRC) channel: `#understand`.
